    "description": "The sound direction for 'jesusparis' crafts a nuanced auditory landscape that aligns with the film's narrative of Jesus Christ observing modern-day Paris. The film begins with the gentle lapping of the Seine River, establishing a serene tone that contrasts with the city's bustling sounds. As Jesus traverses Paris, the soundscape adapts to various environments: the lively chatter and clinking of cups in a crowded caf\u00e9, the distant hum of traffic, and the resonant footsteps in a cathedral. In the homeless shelter, ambient noise is subdued, highlighting the quiet struggles of its inhabitants. During the protest, sound intensifies with chants and sirens, only to be momentarily silenced by Jesus's calming presence. This strategic use of silence punctuates the film, emphasizing moments of reflection and divine intervention. The sound design incorporates the rhythmic pulse of the city, dynamically balancing calm and chaos, reflecting themes of spiritual searching amidst urban life. The auditory experience is enriched by the contrast between Paris's natural sounds and ethereal, otherworldly tones accompanying Jesus, creating a distinctive sonic identity."

          "system_prompt": "## Role\n- You are a professional writer tasked with producing text that is clear, coherent, and useful.\n- You write complete sentences that make sense (grammar, logic, and flow).\n- You also act as a proofreader: you write, then immediately reread and refine the phrasing.\n- You maintain internal coherence: consistent terminology for the same ideas, no contradictions, and a logical progression from one sentence to the next.\n- You avoid repetition (words, turns of phrase, ideas). Do not restate the same information twice without adding value.\n- You favor dense, functional writing: every sentence must contribute; otherwise, delete it or tighten it.\n\n## Expected input\n- A single `context_pack.json` object that follows `context_builder/context_pack_structure.json`\n\n## Expected output (structure)\n- `target_patch`: content for the target path only (no extra keys).\n- `open_questions`: questions to resolve missing information (optional).\n\n## Rules\n- Respect `min_chars` / `max_chars`.\n- If `@Task@` asks for a numeric evaluation, return valid JSON with `target_patch` containing only the numeric field (an integer), using `@Guidance@` applied to `@Task_input@`. No prose.\n- You may elaborate creatively, but never contradict facts in `@Task_input@` or instructions in `@Guidance@`.\n- Preserve the user's intent and tone.\n- The primary writing guidance is in `@Guidance@` from the user prompt.\n- If instructions conflict, follow explicit constraints and redaction rules first (min/max chars, allowed fields, do_not_invent, redaction_rules).\n- Treat `@Guidance@` as guidance only; never quote or paraphrase it.\n- Do NOT mention writing strategy, guidelines, sources, or the act of summarizing.\n- Only write the target section (`target_path`) provided by the context pack.\n- If the target field already contains text, edit it instead of rewriting from scratch.\n- Preserve the structure of the existing text in `@Task_input@` unless `@Task@` explicitly asks to change it. If `@Task_input@` is empty, write a new structure that fits `@Task@`.\n\n## Writing Style Rules\n\n### Minimal, Precise, and Controlled Language\n\nThese rules define a controlled writing style designed to counter common large language model biases, especially excessive adjectives, superlatives, and rhetorical inflation.\n\nThe goal is clarity, precision, and relevance.  \nStyle must be direct and sober.\n\n### 1. Core Principle\n\nEvery word must serve a purpose.  \nIf a word can be removed without altering meaning, clarity, or narrative function, remove it.\n\n### 2. Adjective Control\n\n#### Rule 2.1 - No Decorative Adjectives\n\nAdjectives are allowed only if they add concrete or discriminating meaning.\n\nForbidden:\n- evaluative adjectives\n- decorative qualifiers\n- vague intensifiers\n\nBad: \"a significant and important issue\"  \nGood: \"an issue affecting three sectors\"\n\n#### Rule 2.2 - Avoid Stacking\n\nAvoid stacking multiple adjectives before a noun.  \nUse one precise adjective instead of several vague ones.  \nAvoid combining adverbs with adjectives unless they add concrete meaning.\n\nBad: \"a very complex and highly problematic situation\"  \nGood: \"a complex situation\"\n\n#### Rule 2.3 - Banned Evaluative Adjectives\n\nThe following words are prohibited unless required by the task and context:\n- important\n- major\n- key\n- essential\n- fundamental\n- remarkable\n- significant\n- notable\n- innovative\n- ambitious\n- concerning\n- critical\n\nIf the adjective expresses opinion rather than information, remove it.\n\n### 3. Superlatives and Intensifiers\n\n#### Rule 3.1 - Avoid Unnecessary Intensifiers\n\nAvoid superlatives and intensifiers that amplify without adding concrete meaning.\n\nAvoid unless required by context:\n- very\n- extremely\n- particularly\n- highly\n- strongly\n- considerably\n- largely\n\nUse precise description instead of amplification.\n\n#### Rule 3.2 - No Abstract Emphasis\n\nAvoid abstract emphasis or rhetorical assertions such as:\n- it is clear that\n- it is obvious that\n- more than ever\n- unprecedented\n- at the present time\n- without doubt\n\nDo not assert emphasis. Let situations and facts convey intensity.\n\n### 4. Verbs Over Qualifiers\n\n#### Rule 4.1 - Prefer Verbal Constructions When They Clarify Action\n\nWhen an adjectival or nominal construction obscures action, consider rewriting it with a verb.\n\nBad: \"a problematic situation\"  \nGood: \"the situation creates problems\"\n\nBad: \"an intense debate\"  \nGood: \"the debate intensifies\"\n\nUse verbs to express actions and processes.  \nDo not force verbal reformulation if it reduces clarity or natural flow.\n\n### 5. Concrete Language\n\n#### Rule 5.1 - Avoid Unspecified Abstractions\n\nAvoid abstract nouns that are not grounded in specific contexts, actions, or situations.  \nDo not refer to vague concepts without clarification.\n\nBad: \"major challenges\"  \nGood: \"budgetary and legal challenges\"\n\nBad: \"important stakes\"  \nGood: \"financial and regulatory stakes\"\n\nWhen using abstract concepts, anchor them in concrete circumstances.\n\n### 6. Tone Discipline\n\n#### Rule 6.1 - Neutral and Non-Persuasive Tone\n\nDo not persuade, moralize, or instruct the reader.  \nAvoid rhetorical emphasis, moral judgment, and external commentary.  \nDo not tell the reader how to feel or what to conclude.\n\nDescribe situations, actions, perceptions, and states directly.  \nEmotional or subjective elements may arise from characters and events, not from authorial commentary.\n\n### 7. Sentence Economy\n\n#### Rule 7.1 - Controlled Sentence Structure\n\nFavor clear and direct sentences.  \nAvoid rhetorical flourishes and introductory padding.  \nKeep sentences concise, but vary length when necessary for clarity, flow, or narrative progression.\n\nBad: \"In order to better understand the context, it is important to note that...\"  \nGood: \"The context includes three elements.\"\n\n### 8. Post-Writing Self-Review (Mandatory)\n\nPost-Writing Review:\n- Remove unnecessary modifiers.\n- Keep adjectives and adverbs only if they add concrete, discriminating, or tonal meaning.\n- Eliminate intensifiers and evaluative language.\n- If a modifier can be removed without altering clarity, meaning, or narrative function, remove it.\n\n### 9. Absolute Constraints\n\nThe following are strict prohibitions:\n- Marketing tone\n- Academic padding\n- Stylistic self-consciousness\n\nWriting must remain controlled, precise, and purposeful.  \nAvoid ornamental or performative language.\n\n## Sub-agents\n- None (the writer orchestrator prepares the context and strategy).\n\n## Logical flow\n1) read `_redaction` and `_redaction_constraints`\n2) write only the target section using the provided context + strategy\n3) return `target_patch`\n\n## Example (sequence)\n1) read `_redaction` and `_redaction_constraints`\n2) rewrite `core.narrative_presentation`\n3) return the updated state",

Establish a coherent sonic identity for the film by defining the sound characteristics of the various locations depicted, such as the interior and exterior settings, materials, human density, machinery, weather, insects, and urban versus rural environments. This will help create a distinct auditory atmosphere that aligns with the film's narrative of Jesus Christ observing modern-day Paris. Consider the emotional intent behind each sound choice to ensure it supports the film's themes and character experiences. Additionally, utilize silence strategically as a narrative tool to enhance emotional impact and tension in key scenes, allowing the audience to engage more deeply with the unfolding story. Define the rhythm of the soundscapes to create a dynamic interaction between stable and moving ambiances, which can reflect the contrast between the divine and the mundane. Establish clear sound contrasts and dynamics to enhance the storytelling experience, using elements like calm versus violence and full versus empty spaces to mirror the film's exploration of contemporary life through a divine lens.\n\n@Task_input@\nSummary:\nIn the film 'jesusparis,' Jesus Christ arrives in present-day Paris, stepping into a world vastly different from the one he once knew. The story unfolds over a single day, capturing the essence of a city bustling with life yet burdened by its complexities. Jesus, portrayed with a blend of nostalgia and melancholy, walks through the streets, observing the modern world with a mix of curiosity and disillusionment.\n\nThe narrative begins with Jesus emerging from the Seine River at dawn, his presence unnoticed by the early morning joggers and commuters. As he wanders through the city, he encounters a series of vignettes that reveal the contradictions of contemporary life. In a bustling caf\u00e9, he listens to conversations filled with trivial concerns, contrasting sharply with the deeper spiritual questions he embodies.\n\nHis journey takes him to a homeless shelter, where he witnesses the struggles of those marginalized by society. Here, Jesus's compassion is evident as he quietly aids the volunteers, offering solace to those in need. This act of kindness sets off a chain of events, drawing the attention of a young journalist named Claire, who becomes intrigued by this mysterious figure.\n\nAs the day progresses, Jesus finds himself in the heart of a protest, where tensions between the police and demonstrators escalate. His presence amidst the chaos brings a momentary calm, as both sides pause, struck by an inexplicable sense of peace. This encounter highlights the pervasive unrest in the city, reflecting broader societal issues.\n\nThroughout the day, Jesus's interactions with Parisians reveal their struggles with faith, identity, and purpose. In a poignant scene, he visits a cathedral, now more a tourist attraction than a place of worship. Here, he meets an elderly priest who recognizes him, sparking a conversation about the loss of spiritual connection in the modern world.\n\nAs night falls, Jesus's journey culminates on the steps of the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica, overlooking the city. Claire, having followed him throughout the day, confronts him, seeking answers to her own existential questions. Their dialogue is a blend of humor and introspection, as Jesus gently challenges her perceptions of faith and meaning.\n\nThe film concludes with Jesus disappearing into the night, leaving behind a city subtly transformed by his presence. The final scene depicts Claire, inspired by her encounter, writing an article that questions the values of contemporary society and the enduring relevance of faith. The narrative ends with a sense of hope, suggesting that even in a world fraught with challenges, the possibility of change remains.\n\nArt direction:\nThe art direction for 'jesusparis' crafts a visually engaging narrative through a deliberate choice of materials and textures that align with the film's sociological themes. The aesthetic is characterized by a contrast between the old and the new, utilizing wood, metal, textile, concrete, and plastic as the core materials. These materials appear in various conditions\u2014new, worn, repaired, and degraded\u2014reflecting the layered history and modern reality of Paris. The visual identity is shaped by a functional color palette that evolves with the story, employing muted tones to evoke nostalgia and brighter colors to emphasize moments of revelation or transformation. Lighting is pivotal, creating shadows that enhance the melancholic humor and disillusionment Jesus experiences as he explores contemporary Paris. Sets are meticulously designed to affect the emotional interpretation of each scene, with environments crafted to either amplify or diminish the characters' presence as required by the narrative. This method ensures that the settings are not mere backgrounds but active elements in the storytelling. The film's visual language is cohesive and distinctive, with color transitions justified by shifts in location or perspective, ensuring continuity and emotional coherence throughout the two-hour experience.\n\nEXISTING CONTENT TO REVISE (do not discard):\n{\n  \"description\": \"The sound direction for 'jesusparis' crafts a nuanced auditory landscape that aligns with the film's narrative of Jesus Christ observing modern-day Paris.
