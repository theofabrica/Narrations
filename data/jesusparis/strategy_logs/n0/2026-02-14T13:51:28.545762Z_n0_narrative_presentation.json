The audience leaves with a rounded, closed experience- nothing in doubt, nothing unsated. Miniplot, on the other hand, often leaves the ending somewhat open. Most of the questions raised by the telling are answered, but an unanswered question or two may trail out of the film, leaving the audience to supply it subsequent to the viewing. Most of the emotion evoked by the film will be satisfied, but an emotional residue may be left for the audience to satisfy.

MAJOR DRAMATIC IRONIES At the foundation stage, you must think about the major dramatic ironies that will run throughout the second act, or at least a good part of it. Present them in the order of appearance in the story. It is possible that one or more dramatic ironies are already inherent in your subject. If, for example, you want to tell the story of aliens who take human form to discover Earth (3rd planet after the Sun), you automatically have two major dramatic ironies: 1 - we know that the protagonists are aliens, the other characters do not; 2 - we know earthly customs, the protagonists do not. In these cases, be aware of them. But sometimes, no dramatic irony is imposed by the subject. Victim and protagonist I distinguish two major categories of dramatic irony: the one where the victim of the dramatic irony is also the victim of the conflict (i.e., the protagonist) and the one where the victim of the dramatic irony is a character other than the protagonist. As examples of the first category, which I call \"bomb under the table,\" we find: - The Apartment: we know that Fran (Shirley MacLaine) is Sheldrake's (Fred MacMurray) mistress; Baxter (Jack Lemmon), the protagonist, does not; - Jean de Florette: we know that Papet (Yves Montand) and Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil) have blocked the spring; Jean (G\u00e9rard Depardieu), the protagonist, does not; - The Night of t",

A desire that remains weak throughout the story diminishes the hero, and, as for the plot, makes any complexity literally impossible. The weakest degree of desire, for example, is survival. The hero is attacked and seeks to escape. This lowers him to the animal stage. The plot of escape stories tends to simply repeat the same highlights of the escape. Below are the different degrees of some of the classic lines of desire, from weakest to strongest: ###tory00460### 1. Survive (escape) ###tory00461### 2. Take revenge ###tory00462### 3.

The quality of the Inciting Incident (for that matter, any event) must be germane to the world, characters, and genre surrounding it. Once it is conceived, the writer must concentrate on its function. Does the Inciting Incident radically upset the balance of forces in the protagonist's life? Does it arouse in the protagonist the desire to restore balance? Does it inspire in him the conscious desire for that object, material or immaterial, he feels would restore the balance? In a complex protagonist, does it also bring to life an unconscious desire that contradicts his conscious need? Does it launch the protagonist on a quest for his desire?

In Chapter 8, you'll see that another element of the beginning, the \"specter,\" can also express the hero's weakness. The connection between the hero and his universe begins with the hero's servitude and continues throughout the character's arc. In most stories, as the hero is an expression of the world and the world an expression of the hero, they both develop together. And if the hero doesn't change, as in most of Chekhov's works, the world doesn't change either. Let's now study some classic examples of transformations, contrasts, or non-transformations of the hero and his world throughout the story.

AVOID DEUS EX MACHINA AND CONVENIENCES A deus ex machina is a narrative element that comes to help the protagonist and gives the unpleasant impression of appearing out of nowhere. In reality, the viewer senses that this element doesn't come out of nowhere but from the author's hat, making it even more unpleasant. In a broad sense, a deus ex machina is any convenience that suits the author. Managing the aids and solutions for the protagonist is a significant part of our activity. There are several ways to avoid a deus ex machina. The most radical solution is to ensure that the help comes from the protagonist themselves and not from outside. Any protagonist worthy of the name finds within themselves the resources to get out of trouble. That said, unless you're called MacGyver (MacGyver), a protagonist can't do everything, provoke a solar eclipse, resurrect their neighbor, or master nuclear fission overnight. Here are some techniques to avoid conveniences. Note: Some can be combined. 1. Preparation. Prepare the help. Preparation is the great antidote to deus ex machina.

  "strategy_text": "1. Begin by establishing the protagonist's actions that provoke escalating antagonism, ensuring that each action leads to more significant challenges and avoids lesser efforts. This will maintain narrative progression and keep the story dynamic. 2. Use a temporal technique, such as setting the story over a single day, to create simultaneous movement and maintain narrative dynamism. This approach compresses the story's timeline, forcing it to move forward and keeping the audience engaged. 3. Focus on integrating character, action, and dialogue in each event to evoke specific emotions. This will ensure the narrative is coherent and engaging, drawing the audience into the story. 4. Structure the narrative to enhance its plausibility and unity by linking scenes that create a persistent emotional question. This will engage the audience and provide a cohesive story experience. 5. Align thematic elements with a structured narrative to create an organic plot. Ensure that character actions reflect the guiding principle, reinforcing the story's themes and messages. 6. Introduce an Inciting Incident that drives the protagonist's quest and reveals deeper desires. This incident should be pivotal for narrative progression, setting the stage for the protagonist's journey. 7. Continuously escalate conflict and avoid repetitive actions that stall progression. This will maintain audience engagement and keep the narrative dynamic. 8. Use the protagonist's desire as the 'Spine' of the story, connecting all elements and driving the narrative forward. This central desire should guide the protagonist's actions and decisions throughout the story. 9. Ensure narrative dynamism by focusing on conflict and pacing, with the hero's actions and adversarial challenges driving the story forward. This will keep the audience invested in the protagonist's journey. 10. Avoid deus ex machina and narrative conveniences by ensuring that the protagonist finds solutions from within themselves. Prepare any external help in advance to maintain narrative integrity and avoid undermining the story's believability.",
