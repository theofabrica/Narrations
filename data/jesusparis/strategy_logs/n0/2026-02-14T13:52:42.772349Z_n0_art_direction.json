Consider the dominant materials such as wood, metal, textile, concrete, and plastic, and their states (new, worn, repaired, degraded) to create a structured visual system that reflects the story's themes. 2. Create a foundational lookbook that outlines the visual intentions and functional color palettes for the film. This document should include a clear and concise general intention, major visual axes, and functional rather than decorative color palettes to guide the overall aesthetic. 3. Consider the emotional reading of each shot by carefully constructing sets and using lighting to influence the viewer's perception. The physical relationship between characters and their environments should be designed to enhance the emotional impact of the scenes. 4. Anticipate how the environments can affect the characters' presence within the frame. Design spaces that can either amplify, diminish, or neutralize a character's presence, depending on the narrative needs, to ensure that the art direction supports the storytelling. 5. Use color as a structural element that evolves throughout the film to maintain continuity and emotional coherence. Ensure that any changes in color dominance are justified by shifts in location, perspective, or world, to support the narrative progression and emotional journey.",
