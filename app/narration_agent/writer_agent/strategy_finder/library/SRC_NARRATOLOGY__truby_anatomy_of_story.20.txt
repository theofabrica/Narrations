The challenge of storytelling lies in overcoming traditional narrative structures and creating an organic story that feels natural and engaging.
- Classical narrative terms and models like Aristotle's Poetics and the three-act structure are too theoretical and reductive, often leading to mechanical and episodic storytelling.
- Many authors rely on mechanical processes, resulting in generic and unoriginal stories that fail to connect with audiences.
- A good story should be organic, evolving naturally with characters and plots that develop from the original idea.
- Mastering storytelling requires precise techniques that make the technical aspects invisible, much like an athlete's seamless performance.

###tory00004###
THE STORYTELLER AND THE AUDIENCE
A story involves a storyteller conveying what someone did to achieve their desires and why, engaging the audience through a blend of emotional and intellectual elements.
- A storyteller plays with the audience, crafting a narrative that feels complete and immersive.
- Effective storytelling involves selecting and connecting intense moments that allow the audience to experience the essence of life.

- Twists serve as the nervous system,

###tory00007###
MOVEMENT OF THE STORY
Storytellers use natural patterns to connect narrative elements over time, similar to nature's sequences.
- Patterns include linear, zigzag, spiral, branching, and explosive.
- Linear patterns follow a straight sequence, while explosive patterns occur simultaneously.
- Zigzag, spiral, and branching are combinations of linear and explosive patterns.

- Most American films use a linear pattern with a single hero.
- The hero intensely pursues one desire, showcasing their evolution.

###tory00009###
The Zigzag Narrative
Zigzag stories feature a meandering path with a hero encountering diverse characters across various settings.

###tory00013###
WRITING YOUR OWN STORY
Most authors use an external, mechanical, fragmented, and generic writing process, but a more effective approach is internal, organic, interconnected, and original.
- Start with a premise that condenses your narrative into a single sentence, highlighting its essence.
- Develop your story using the seven key steps of narrative structure, which serve as the DNA of your narrative.
- Create interconnected characters from your original idea, ensuring each fulfills a function to help your hero develop.

The Premise
A strong premise is essential for successful storytelling, serving as the foundation for all creative decisions.

- Conflict arises when the hero and adversary share space, allowing for continuous interaction and tension.
- Hannibal Lecter serves as a false adversary, challenging Clarice's weaknesses to help her grow.

TECHNIQUE: THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF DESIRE

###tory00459###
Part of the success of your story depends on the degree of desire you give your hero. A desire that remains weak throughout the story diminishes the hero, and, as for the plot, makes any complexity literally impossible. The weakest degree of desire, for example, is survival. The hero is attacked and seeks to escape. This lowers him to the animal stage. The plot of escape stories tends to simply repeat the same highlights of the escape.
Below are the different degrees of some of the classic lines of desire, from weakest to strongest:

###tory00460###
1. Survive (escape)

###tory00461###
2. Take revenge

6. Ally(ies)
The hero's journey involves forming alliances, with allies needing their own desires to appear complete but not overshadow the hero.
- Allies should have their own goals to seem like complete characters.
- Ensure the ally is not more interesting than the hero.
- If the ally is more compelling, consider making them the hero.

###tory00472###

TOOTSIE
Jeff, Michael's roommate, is writing a play, Return to the Love Canal, and Michael wants it to be staged so he can play a role in it.

###tory00474###
TECHNIQUE: THE SUBPLOT
Subplots serve to compare the hero's approach to situations with another character's, impacting the main plot and enhancing the story.
- Ensure the subplot impacts the main plot; otherwise, it creates disjointed stories.
- The secondary character in a subplot is not an ally and provides a comparative narrative.
- Subplots are common in love stories and can enrich characters and themes but may slow narrative momentum.
- Introduce subplots early and ensure they follow a concise structure to avoid an incomplete story.

###tory00475###
7. Adversary / Mystery
The adversary is crucial in a story, challenging the hero and shaping the plot through conflict and mystery.

###tory00478###
TECHNIQUE: THE ICEBERG ADVERSARY
Mysterious adversaries enhance a story's tension and depth.
- Conceal most of the adversary's motives and intentions.
- Reveal only a small, visible part of their character.
- Use hidden elements to increase their perceived danger.

###tory00479###
1. Create a hierarchy of adversaries with a number of alliances. All adversaries are linked to each other; they work together to defeat the hero. The main adversary is at the top of the pyramid, with the others under his power. (Refer to the section of chapter 4 that deals with the four-corner opposition. You will find an illustration of this technique at the end of this chapter, where the example of The Godfather is developed.)
Mysterious adversaries should have hidden motives revealed gradually to enhance plot tension.
- Conceal the hierarchy and true desires of adversaries from both hero and audience.
- Gradually reveal information at an increasing pace, adding twists towards the story's end.

- Death does not provide ultimate understanding; acting with awareness of mortality gives life meaning.
- Narration and reflection shape the story's meaning, which evolves over time.
