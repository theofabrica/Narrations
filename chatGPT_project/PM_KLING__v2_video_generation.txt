Comprehensive Guide to Promp2ng Kling 2.0 (Image-to-Video AI Model) 
Kling 2.0 is a powerful image-to-video deep learning model that can transform sta:c images 
(or text prompts) into dynamic video clips. Whether you want a cinema:c movie shot, a 
cartoon anima:on, a stylized art piece, a product showcase, a natural landscape, or a sci-ﬁ 
scene, craBing the right prompt is key. This guide will walk you through prompt structure, 
eﬀec:ve techniques for beginners and advanced users, and :ps for various video styles. We’ll 
also cover nega:ve prompts, camera movements, chaining mul:ple scenes, ensuring 
consistency, and avoiding common piIalls. Let’s dive in! 
Prompt Structure and Syntax for Kling 2.0 
A well-structured prompt is the founda:on of a good Kling video. Kling prompts are typically 
wriMen as one or two descrip:ve sentences, covering the who, what, where, and how of 
your scene. According to Kling’s oﬃcial recommenda:ons, an ideal prompt should include 
the following elementslearn.rundiﬀusion.com: 

•  Subject – The main focus of your video (e.g. a person, animal, 

object)learn.rundiﬀusion.com. 

•  Subject Descrip2on – Key details about the subject’s appearance or aMributes (e.g. 

clothing, color, size, expression)learn.rundiﬀusion.com. 

•  Subject Movement – What the subject is doing or how it’s moving (e.g. running, 

waving, turning)learn.rundiﬀusion.com. 

•  Scene – The seRng or environment where the ac:on occurs (e.g. a crowded city 

street, a forest at dusk)learn.rundiﬀusion.com. 

•  Scene Descrip2on – Extra details about the seRng (e.g. weather, background 

elements, atmosphere)learn.rundiﬀusion.com. 

•  Camera & Style (op2onal) – Any speciﬁc camera movement or angle, ligh:ng style, or 
overall mood to enhance the cinema:c feel (e.g. wide angle shot, so. golden light, 
tense atmosphere)learn.rundiﬀusion.com. 

These components can be arranged into a prompt formula. A simple syntax template is: 
“[Subject], [subject descrip2on], [subject movement] in [scene]. [Scene descrip2on]. 
[Camera angle/mo2on], [ligh2ng], [atmosphere].” 
For example, a prompt following this structure might be: 
“A young woman (subject) wearing a ﬂowing red dress (subject descrip/on) sprints joyfully 
(subject movement) across a sunlit meadow (scene). Wildﬂowers sway in the breeze and 
birds ﬂy overhead (scene descrip/on). Wide aerial shot, so. golden light, dreamy 
atmosphere (camera & style).” 
This prompt clearly deﬁnes the main subject, what she’s doing, the seRng, and stylis:c cues 
– providing a strong blueprint for Kling to generate the 
videolearn.rundiﬀusion.comlearn.rundiﬀusion.com. 
Image-to-Video vs Text-to-Video: If you are using image-to-video, you already supply a base 
image, which gives context for the scene. In that case, your prompt can focus more on 
describing the subjects in the image and how they move, since the seRng is partly deﬁned 
by the imageytscribe.com. For text-to-video (no ini:al image), you must describe the scene 
from scratch along with the subject. The prompt structure is similar, but scene descrip:on 
becomes crucial because Kling has no visual reference without an image. 
Write in natural language. Unlike some older AI image models that relied on comma-
separated keywords, Kling responds well to prompts wriMen as descrip:ve sentences. You 
can use rich, vivid language and even mul:ple sentences – just ensure they are coherent and 
focused. Clarity is more important than brevity. Aim to be concise but speciﬁc in detailing 

the elements abovelearn.rundiﬀusion.com. In the next sec:ons, we’ll break down each 
component of the prompt and how to use it eﬀec:vely. 
Key Components of an Eﬀec2ve Kling Prompt 
Each part of your prompt plays a role in guiding Kling 2.0. Here’s how to craZ each 
component for maximum eﬀect: 
1. Subject and Scene Descrip2on 
Begin by iden:fying what the video is about – the main subject and the environment. Being 
speciﬁc here will greatly improve the relevance of the output. 

•  Subject Detail: Clearly state who or what is the focus. Instead of a vague phrase like 
“someone” or “an object,” specify details. For example, rather than “Show someone 
using tools,” a beMer descrip:on would be “A mechanic in gray overalls repairs a 
motorcycle engine, tools spread out on a red toolbox”blog.segmind.com. This level of 
detail gives Kling concrete visuals to work with. Men:on aMributes like color, clothing, 
size, or any dis:nc:ve features of the subject. 

•  Scene SeZng: Describe where the ac:on takes place. Name the loca:on or seRng 

type (a kitchen, a rainforest, outer space, etc.), and include sensory details if relevant. 
For instance, “in a small vintage kitchen with sunlight through the window” or “on a 
distant planet with two moons in the sky”. Providing contextual details (weather, 
:me of day, background objects) helps the AI render a richer sceneblog.segmind.com. 
A good scene descrip2on paints a clear picture: e.g. “The garage has LED lights 
overhead and vintage car posters on the walls” as opposed to just “in a 
garage.”blog.segmind.com 

•  Rela2on Between Subject and Scene: Write the prompt so that everything 

happening is anchored to the subject. The subject typically comes ﬁrst in the 
sentence, and then you describe the scene in rela:on to that subjectytscribe.com. For 
example: “A cyclist rests by a fountain in a busy city plaza. Pedestrians bustle around 
and pigeons ﬂy past.” Here the subject (“a cyclist”) is the anchor, and the scene 
elements (“busy city plaza”, pedestrians, pigeons) relate to that subject. 

•  For Image-to-Video: Leverage details from your base image. If your input image is a 
pain:ng of a castle, your prompt might start with “A medieval castle on a hilltop…” 
and then describe what new mo:on or event you want in that scene. You don’t need 
to re-describe the obvious content of the image, but you can add new elements or 
emphasize certain aspects. Ensure the prompt doesn’t contradict the image – for 
instance, if the image is a day:me scene, promp:ng “under a night sky” will force 
Kling to alter the :me of day dras:cally, which could cause unnatural results. Align 
prompt details with the image or only make gradual changes (like “the leaves begin to 
fall from the trees” if the image is a forest scene). 

•  For Text-to-Video: Provide enough scene detail to compensate for the lack of an 

image. Deﬁne the seRng thoroughly: if it’s outdoors, men:on ground and sky details; 
if it’s indoors, describe the room and props. This helps avoid empty or blurry 
backgrounds. For example: “A lone hiker stands at the edge of a cliﬀ overlooking a 
vast canyon. The sky is ﬁlled with pink sunrise hues and low clouds dri. between the 
cliﬀs.” The vivid scene descrip:on here guides Kling to generate a detailed 
environment rather than a generic void. 

Tip: More detail is usually beLer than too liLle. Prompts that lack detail yield bland 
outputsblog.segmind.com. Give speciﬁc cues for every major element you want visible. 

However, avoid stuﬃng in irrelevant details – each detail should contribute to the scene you 
envision. We’ll discuss over-complica:ng prompts in the PiIalls sec:on. 
2. Style and Visual Elements 
Next, consider how the video should look and feel. Kling 2.0 oﬀers a lot of ﬂexibility in visual 
style, from photorealis:c to highly stylized. You can control this through your choice of 
adjec:ves and style tags in the prompt: 

• 

Ligh2ng: Describe the ligh:ng condi:ons, as ligh:ng drama:cally aﬀects mood. 
Examples: so. morning sunlight, harsh neon lighMng, warm golden hour glow, dim 
candlelight. Speciﬁc ligh:ng cues help Kling replicate that 
ambianceblog.segmind.com. For a drama:c cinema:c feel, you might say “dramaMc, 
high-contrast lighMng” or “so. diﬀused backlight outlining the subject.” 

•  Color Pale‘e: Men:on the overall color tone if you have a preference. E.g. “warm, 
earthy tones”, “cool blue and silver tones”, “vibrant neon colors”. This ensures the 
video’s color grading matches your visionblog.segmind.com. For instance, “muted 
pastel paleLe” would yield a diﬀerent feel than “bold primary colors.” 

•  Visual Style or Genre: Include keywords for the style or genre. For example, cinemaMc 
(for ﬁlm-like polish), documentary-style, cartoonish, surreal, photorealisMc, arMsMc, 
hyper-real, retro, cyberpunk, etc. A prompt could say “in a cinema2c style” or “with 
comic-book style visuals” depending on the output you wantblog.segmind.com. We’ll 
explore speciﬁc styles (cinema:c, animated, etc.) in a dedicated sec:on below. 
•  Camera Angles & Composi2on: You can specify the type of shot as part of the style. 
For example, “wide-angle view”, “close-up shot”, “ﬁrst-person perspecMve”, “low-
angle shot looking up”, etc.blog.segmind.com. This is especially useful if you want a 
par:cular framing – a wide establishing shot versus an in:mate close-up can change 
the storytelling. You might say “over-the-shoulder shot” for a perspec:ve peeking 
from behind a character, or “aerial drone view” for a bird’s-eye scene. 

•  Mood/Atmosphere: Descrip:ve mood words can inﬂuence the tone. Terms like 

dreamy, whimsical, tense, gloomy, cheerful, epic, tranquil help convey the emo:onal 
atmospherelearn.rundiﬀusion.com. For example, “a tense, griLy atmosphere” vs “a 
playful, magical atmosphere” will guide Kling to add appropriate touches (like darker 
shadows and handheld camera for grit, or bright ligh:ng and smooth mo:on for a 
magical feel). 

•  Stylis2c References: You can reference known art or ﬁlm styles in modera:on. For 

instance, “in the style of an anime ﬁlm”, “Pixar-like 3D animaMon”, or “ﬁlm noir style”. 
Be cau:ous with trademarked names or exact :tles, but general references (e.g. 
“Studio Ghibli-inspired”, “80s cartoon style”, “modern Marvel movie style”) can steer 
the aesthe:c. Make sure all style references in one prompt are compa:ble; avoid 
mixing too many diﬀerent styles together (e.g. “watercolor painMng style” with 
“photorealisMc” in one scene might confuse the model). 

•  Consistency in Style: If you plan to chain mul:ple scenes or just want a cohesive look, 
keep your style descriptors consistent across prompts. For example, if the ﬁrst scene 
is “bright and cartoonish”, use similar language for the next scenes so the visuals 
match. If you switch styles (say, from realisMc to sketch drawing style in the next 
prompt) the diﬀerence will be no:ceable if those scenes are placed back-to-back. 

Example: “A medieval marketplace at noon, depicted in a painterly, oil pain/ng style. So; 
sunlight falls on stone walls, and colors are slightly muted for an old-fashioned look.” – This 

prompt deﬁnes a stylized look (painterly), ligh:ng (soZ noon sun), and color tone (muted), 
guiding Kling toward an ar:s:c, historic feel rather than modern photorealism. 
3. Mo2on Cues and Camera Instruc2ons 
One of the most exci:ng parts of promp:ng Kling is describing movement – both of the 
subject and the camera. Mo:on brings your video to life, so providing clear instruc:ons here 
is crucial. 

•  Subject Movement: Describe how the main subject moves or changes. This could be 
an ac:on (“a man jogs down the street”, “a cat jumps onto a table”, “volcanic smoke 
billows from the crater”) or even subtle mo:on (“the girl’s hair s/rs in the wind”). If 
the subject is staMc but something else in the scene moves (like falling leaves or 
waves), you can treat those moving elements as part of the scene descrip:on. Be 
speciﬁc: instead of “make it move” or “there is movement”, say “the camera crane 
rises as the eagle takes oﬀ, following the eagle’s ascent” or “the train approaches in 
the distance”. The more clearly you describe the mo:on, the more likely Kling will 
render it correctlyblog.segmind.com. Avoid vague phrases like “add movement” – 
always specify what moves and how. 

•  Camera Movement & Angles: You can direct the “virtual camera” ﬁlming the scene. 

Common camera movements include: 

o  Panning: e.g. “camera pans slowly from le. to right”. 
o  TilMng: e.g. “camera Mlts upward to reveal the skyline”. 
o  Tracking/Following: e.g. “camera tracks the horse from the side as it runs” or 

“camera follows behind the cyclist”. (This is like the camera moving along with 
the subject). 

o  Zooming: e.g. “gradual zoom in on the face” or for a quick drama:c eﬀect 

“fast zoom toward the object”landofgeek.com. 

o  OrbiMng: e.g. “camera circles around the statue 360 degrees”. 
o  StaMc: If you do NOT want the camera to move at all (a locked-oﬀ shot), 

explicitly say so. Use phrases like “staMc camera”, “staMc shot”, or “camera 
remains sMll” at the start of your promptageoﬂlms.comreddit.com. For 
example: “StaMc camera shot of a puppy si[ng in place…”. This tells Kling to 
keep the viewpoint ﬁxed. (By default, AI videos oZen introduce some camera 
driZ, so adding “staMc” ensures a stable shot.) 

Camera cues in the prompt can be appended aZer describing the scene, or even integrated 
as a clause: e.g. “…as seen in a steady, sta/c wide shot” or “…the camera zooming in slowly 
on the ﬂower”. Many users ﬁnd success by men:oning the camera movement aBer 
describing the subject’s ac:on, tying it to the subject. For instance: “A dancer twirls on stage, 
the camera smoothly orbi/ng around her.” This approach keeps the prompt natural and 
clear about how the camera relates to the subjectytscribe.com. 

•  Cinema2c Mo2on Eﬀects: You can ask for advanced eﬀects: 

o  Slow Mo2on: Use phrases like “in slow moMon” or “a slow-moMon sequence 
of...” to have Kling simulate high-frame-rate slow-mo:onfal.ai. For example: 
“slow-moMon shot of a glass shaLering, parMcles glinMng in the light.” 

o  Fast Mo2on/Time-Lapse: Words like “fast-paced” or “Mme-lapse” can indicate 
rapid mo:on. E.g. “Mme-lapse of stars moving across the night sky”. Be careful 
mixing this with normal speed ac:on in one short video; if needed, dedicate 
the whole prompt to a :me-lapse style scene. 

o  First-Person View (FPV): If you want the perspec:ve as if through the eyes of 
the subject (common in ac:on or drone shots), use “FPV” or describe it as 
“ﬁrst-person perspecMve”. For instance: “FPV footage of racing through a 
forest” gives a visceral, from-the-eyes viewlandofgeek.com. 

o  Handheld/Shaky Cam: Including “handheld camera” or “shaky” can introduce 
a realis:c shake (like a documentary or found-footage style). “Camera shakes 
as it follows the running protagonist” implies a frene:c, urgent mood. Use 
this sparingly – while “shaky cam” can add drama, too much shake might 
make the video chao:c or reduce visual consistencylandofgeek.com. A hint 
like “slightly shaky, handheld feel for realism” can suﬃce. 

o  Drone or Crane Shots: Words like “drone shot”, “bird’s-eye view”, or “crane 
shot” indicate high, sweeping camera moves. E.g. “aerial drone shot rising 
above the treetops to reveal a mountain”. 

o  Focus and Depth of Field: Though Kling might not explicitly simulate camera 
lens seRngs, you can try phrases like “shallow depth of ﬁeld” (to focus on 
subject and blur background) or “rack focus to the background”. For example: 
“close-up on the ﬂower with shallow depth of ﬁeld, background so.ly blurred.” 
This is an advanced cue and results can vary, but Kling does understand many 
cinema:c terms. 

•  Order of Mo2on Phrases: Generally, describe the subject and scene ﬁrst, then 

men:on the camera movement and style. For example: “A surfer rides a huge wave 
at sunset, spray ﬂying in the air. Cinema/c slow-mo/on, with the camera panning 
to follow from a low angle.” By structuring it this way, Kling ﬁrst knows what’s 
happening, then how to ﬁlm it. 

•  Avoid Conﬂic2ng Mo2ons: Don’t ask for contradictory movements at the same :me. 
For instance, avoid combining “fast shaky close-ups” with “smooth slow wide pans” in 
one prompt – the model can’t do both simultaneously in one con:nuous 
shotblog.segmind.com. If you need mul:ple styles (like a quick-cut montage), you will 
likely need separate video clips or use edi:ng; a single generated clip should focus on 
one style of movement for coherence. 

Tip: If the camera is doing something very speciﬁc and important (like a complex dolly zoom 
or a sequence of moves), you might need to experiment with phrasing to get it right. Start 
with a simple version of the move in your prompt and generate a test clip. If it’s not what you 
want, adjust the wording. For instance, if “camera pulls back from the subject revealing the 
landscape” doesn’t yield enough pull-back, try elabora:ng: “camera starts close on the 
subject’s face then gradually pulls back to a wide shot revealing the landscape.” Clarity can 
help the AI catch the nuance. 
4. Using Nega2ve Prompts for Higher Quality 
Nega2ve promp2ng is a powerful feature in Kling 2.0 that lets you specify what not to 
include in the video. This can greatly improve quality by elimina:ng unwanted elements, 
ar:facts, or styles. Kling provides a separate ﬁeld for nega:ve prompts, so you don’t need to 
write nega:ves in the main prompt. Here’s how to use them eﬀec:vely: 

•  How Nega2ve Prompts Work: In the nega:ve prompt input, list the things you want 
the AI to avoid. The model interprets any term in this ﬁeld as “do not include this.” 
Therefore, you do not need to add words like "no" or "not" – just puRng the noun 
or adjec:ve is suﬃcientpollo.ai. For example, if you want no text or watermark on the 

video, simply add “text, watermark” to the nega:ve prompt. If you want to avoid a 
par:cular color tone, you might add “monochrome” or “sepia” as nega:ves. 

•  Avoiding Undesired Visual Ar2facts: Common nega:ve prompts for quality include 
terms like “low resoluMon”, “blurry”, “grainy”, “pixelated”, “dark” (if the scene is 
uninten:onally too dark)pollo.ai. Instead of a generic phrase like “low quality”, be 
speciﬁc: for example, use “blurriness” or “low clarity” to target image qualitypollo.ai. 
If Kling some:mes adds unwanted borders or distor:ons, include those (e.g. “frame 
borders”, “distorMon”). 

•  Stylis2c Nega2ves: If the model tends to add a style you don’t want, negate it. For 

instance, if you’re aiming for realism but the output looks cartoonish, you could put 
“cartoon, illustraMon” in the nega:ve prompts. Conversely, if you want a ﬂat cartoon, 
you might negate “photorealism” or “shadows” to avoid realis:c shading. Be cau:ous 
not to negate something essen:al, though – for example, nega:ng “shadows” might 
remove all depth from an image. 

•  Scene and Subject Exclusions: To ensure certain things don’t appear, list them as 

• 

nega:ves. Suppose you’re genera:ng a forest scene and you absolutely don’t want 
any animals in it, you can add “animals” or even speciﬁc ones like “no birds” (just put 
“birds” in nega:ve prompt)pollo.ai. If you want no people, put “people” as a nega:ve. 
Being speciﬁc helps – e.g. “dog” or “robot” is clearer than a broad “creature”. Kling 
will interpret the listed term as something to avoid genera:ngpollo.ai. 
Improving Composi2on and Ligh2ng: You can use nega:ves to avoid certain 
composi:ons or ligh:ng condi:ons that ruin the image. For example, if you ﬁnd the 
video oZen has odd angles or an “unbalanced layout,” you could put “unbalanced 
composiMon” in nega:vespollo.ai. Or if it’s adding “ﬁsh-eye lens” distor:on and you 
don’t want that, negate “ﬁsheye”. Ligh:ng nega:ves might include “overexposed”, 
“too dark”, “harsh shadows”, etc., if those issues come uppollo.ai. For instance, 
adding “overly dark, overly vibrant colors” to nega:ves can push the model toward a 
more moderate, natural exposurepollo.ai. 

•  Tone and Emo2on Nega2ves: You can even inﬂuence the mood by nega:ng tones. If 

you don’t want a video to feel sad or gloomy, you might add “sad, depressing, 
gloomy” as nega:ves (assuming your main prompt doesn’t explicitly require those). 
Kling will then try to avoid those emo:onal tonespollo.ai. This is subtle, but can be 
useful for steering the output (for example, avoiding “angry tone” if you want a happy 
scene)pollo.ai. 

•  When Not to Use Nega2ves: Overusing nega:ve prompts can limit creaMvity and 
some:mes cause the video to look plainpollo.ai. Only use nega:ves for things you 
genuinely want to avoid. If you specify a huge list of nega:ves, you might 
inadvertently strip away too much. For instance, puRng too many visual nega:ves 
might remove both bad and good details. A good prac:ce is to start with just a few 
cri:cal nega:ves (like quality issues or a speciﬁc unwanted object). If the output s:ll 
has undesired elements, itera:vely add to the nega:ve list. Remember, do not 
include the word “no” in the nega:ve prompt ﬁeld – just list the terms (e.g. say 
“rain” rather than “no rain”)pollo.ai. And don’t put nega2ves in the main prompt 
sentence, as Kling’s parser might ignore or misinterpret phrases like “no blur, no 
camera shake” in the promptreddit.com. Use the dedicated nega:ve prompt input for 
those. 

•  Examples of Nega2ve Prompts: 

o  Quality: “blurry, low resolu:on, dark tone, oversaturated” (these aim for a 

sharp, well-exposed result)pollo.ai. 

o  Scene: “indoor” (if you want to ensure an outdoor look, you might negate 
indoor), “rainy, cloudy” (to avoid bad weather if not desired)pollo.ai. 

o  Subjects: “text, watermark, logo” (to avoid AI puRng gibberish text), “insects” 
(if you hate random bugs appearing), “weapons” (if you want to keep it kid-
friendly)pollo.ai. 

o  Style: “cartoon, 2D, drawing” (to avoid an illustrated look if you want realism), 
or the opposite: “photo, realis:c” (if you want it purely cartoon and the AI 
keeps blending in realism). 

o  ArMfacts: “glitches, duplicates” (if some:mes an extra deformed ﬁgure 
appears, you could try nega:ng “duplicate subject” or “double image”). 

Using nega:ve prompts thoughIully can sharpen the focus of your video and reduce the 
trial-and-error needed to get a clean resultpollo.aipollo.ai. It’s especially useful for improving 
realism and clarity. As an example, many creators always include a basic set of nega:ves like 
“low quality, blurry, ﬂicker” to pre-empt common issues, then add scene-speciﬁc nega:ves as 
needed. 
Strategies for Camera Mo2on and Cinema2c Eﬀects 
To achieve professional-looking results, it helps to borrow concepts from ﬁlmmaking. Kling 
2.0’s strength is its ability to mimic various camera techniques and cinema:c eﬀects when 
prompted correctly. Here are some strategies: 

• 

Leverage Camera Presets (Mentally): The Kling interface (Pro mode) includes preset 
camera movements (orbit, steady follow, etc.), which hints at the kinds of mo:ons 
the model excels atlandofgeek.com. Even if you’re wri:ng prompts manually, you can 
mimic these. Think in terms of dis:nct camera styles: 

o  Smooth Orbit: The camera revolves around the subject – prompt with words 
like “orbit around” or “360° around the subject”. Great for showcasing an 
object or character from all sides. 

o  Steady Follow: Camera follows the subject steadily – use “the camera follows 
[subject]” or “tracking shot following [subject]”. Ideal for chase or movement 
scenes. 

o  Handheld/POV: For realism or intensity – phrases like “handheld shot”, “ﬁrst-

person view running behind”. This introduces shake and immediacy. 

o  Sta2onary Tripod: As discussed, “staMc camera” for no movement, focusing 

aMen:on on internal mo:on within the frameageoﬂlms.com. 

o  Drama2c Angles: “Low-angle shot” (camera looks up at subject, making them 
appear larger or heroic) or “high-angle shot” (camera looks down, making 
subject appear small or vulnerable). Use these to set the mood. 
•  Combine Mo2on Keywords for Impact: You can stack mo:on-related keywords to 

dial up the cinema:c intensity. For example: 

o  “High speed, shaky acMon shot” – implies a fast-moving, shaking camera (like 
an ac:on scene). Words like “high speed” or “fast-paced” combined with a 
camera cue will tell Kling to make everything feel quickerlandofgeek.com. 
o  “Slow moMon, sweeping pan” – suggests a drama:c slow-mo with a wide pan 

for grandeur. 

o  “FPV drone ﬂy-through” – ﬁrst-person fast movement through a space. 

o 

If doing an ac2on scene, terms like “high acMon”, “intense”, “dynamic 
camera” can be added. One creator noted that using *“high ac:on” and 
“shaky” together made the output feel like a Michael Bay movie – very 
energe:c and griMylandofgeek.com. Just remember that too much shake can 
reduce frame consistency, so you might balance “shaky” with a lower intensity 
descrip:on (e.g. “slightly shaky”). 

•  Cinema2c Eﬀects: Think about ﬁlm techniques: 

o  Drama2c Reveal: e.g. “camera starts close on the arMfact and then pulls back 
to reveal the enMre temple hall”. This implies a zoom-out or backward dolly 
movement revealing new parts of the scene over :me. 

o  Rack Focus: e.g. “focus shi.s from the foreground candle to the person in the 

background”. It’s an advanced concept and Kling might not perfectly execute a 
focus shiZ, but including it can some:mes yield a moment where one element 
comes into clarity. 

o  Montage or Quick Cuts: Kling won’t cut between totally diﬀerent scenes on its 
own in one genera:on, but you can simulate a quick-cut feel by describing 
very fast mo:on or chaos. Otherwise, actual separate clips edited together is 
needed (discussed in mul:-scene sec:on). If you aMempt mul:ple shots in 
one prompt (like “ﬁrst do this, then suddenly cut to that”), the model might 
blend them into one scene. It’s safer to s:ck to one con:nuous shot per 
prompt. 

o  Lens and Filters: You can men:on lens types or ﬁlm ar:facts: “wide-angle 
lens” (might exaggerate perspec:ve), “telephoto shot” (compressed 
background), “GoPro style ﬁsheye”, “infrared camera view”, “black and white 
ﬁlm grain”. Kling has been known to respond to many of these stylis:c cues. 
For example, “grainy 16mm footage” could add noise and a vintage vibe. Use 
these to match a desired era or medium (like “VHS quality” for a retro eﬀect, 
or “surveillance camera staMc angle” for a security footage feel). 
•  Example – Cinema2c Ac2on: “The sports car dri.s around a corner on a mountain 

road at dusk, Mres kicking up dust. Camera races low and fast alongside the car, with 
a shaky, high-speed chase feellandofgeek.com. Drama/c ligh/ng from the sunset 
silhoueLes the dust cloud.” – This prompt uses camera placement (low and fast 
alongside), adds a shaky high-speed eﬀect for intensity, and ensures ligh:ng is 
drama:c. The result would likely resemble an ac:on movie chase scene. 

•  Example – Gentle Cinema2c: “A couple walks through a quiet park in autumn. Slow, 
steady cam follows them from a distance as leaves fall. So; backligh/ng from the 
late a.ernoon sun creates a warm glow, cinema/c depth of ﬁeld blurring the 
foreground branches.” – This one uses a steady cam (no shake) and slow movement 
for a peaceful tone, plus cinema:c ligh:ng and depth cues. 

•  Check the Result and Iterate: AZer genera:on, review how the mo:on turned out. If 
the camera moved but not as expected, adjust the prompt wording. For instance, if 
you wrote “camera pans” and it barely moved, try “camera pans wide across the 
scene” or increase the emphasis (maybe by phrasing it as an important part of the 
sentence). If the mo:on was too much, you can tone down words like “rapidly” to 
“slowly”, or remove “shaky” if it caused distor:on. 

Remember, cinema:c promp:ng is part art and part science – don’t hesitate to experiment 
with phrasing. Kling 2.0 is quite advanced and “understands” many ﬁlm terms, so enjoy 
pushing the limits of its camera work capabili:es! 
Promp2ng Diﬀerent Types of Video Outputs 
Now let’s focus on :ps for speciﬁc genres or styles of videos. Kling 2.0 can produce a range of 
outputs, from ultra-realis:c footage to stylized fantasy anima:ons. Below are guidelines for 
promp:ng various common categories (cinema:c live-ac:on, animated/cartoon, stylized art, 
product showcases, natural scenes, and sci-ﬁ). 
Cinema2c Videos 
Cinema2c outputs aim to look like professional ﬁlm scenes. The goal is realism with drama:c 
ﬂair, as if shot with a high-end movie camera: 

•  Use Filmic Language: Include words like “cinemaMc”, “ﬁlm-like”, or even speciﬁc ﬁlm 
techniques as men:oned earlier. Describe ligh:ng in cinema:c terms: “dramaMc 
Hollywood lighMng”, “moody shadows”, “so. focus background”. Men:on camera 
equipment if relevant: e.g. “shot on a Steadicam” or “wide anamorphic shot” might 
introduce lens ﬂares or wider aspect feel. 

•  Dynamic Camera and Angles: Cinema:c scenes oZen employ movement. You can 

prompt “tracking shot”, “dolly shot”, “crane shot sweeping over” etc. For epic scale, 
try wide establishing shots (“wide shot of a vast desert as the camera pans across”). 
For in:mate drama, go for close-ups (“Mght close-up on the character’s face as a tear 
falls”). Don’t overload the prompt with too many at once; pick the style that matches 
the scene’s mood. 

•  High Detail and Realism: Emphasize realis:c details – lens ﬂare, depth of ﬁeld, ﬁlm 

grain, etc., if you want a cinema:c realism. For example, “sunlight ﬂares into the lens 
as the camera moves” or “subtle ﬁlm grain for a realisMc touch”. You can also men:on 
frame rate if trying to emulate something (though the model might not strictly 
adhere, phrases like “24fps cinemaMc moMon” could inﬂuence the vibe). 
•  Story and Emo2on: Cinema:c prompts oZen beneﬁt from an implied story or 

emo:on. If relevant, include the character’s emo:on or the scene’s tension. E.g. “a 
cinemaMc sequence of a hero standing amidst a baLleﬁeld, triumphant stance, 
embers ﬂoaMng in the air”. Words like “tense, triumphant, melancholic, suspenseful” 
can guide the atmosphere. 

•  Consistent Tone: Keep the tone consistent. If it’s a dark, griMy scene, maintain that 
through descrip:ons of ligh:ng (dim, shadowy), color (desaturated or cool tones), 
and mo:on (handheld, jiMery perhaps). If it’s a bright adventure, use warm tones, 
smooth movements, etc. Avoid mixing, say, “griLy documentary style” with 
“whimsical magical lighMng” in one scene. 

•  Example Prompt (Cinema2c Live-Ac2on): “At sunset, a lone samurai stands on a 

windy hilltop, cherry blossom petals dri.ing by. Cinema/c composi/on, with a wide-
angle shot capturing the dramaMc sky and the warrior’s silhoueLe. Lens ﬂare from 
the sun peeks around his ﬁgure. Epic, sweeping camera movement slowly circles him, 
and dust motes glow in the golden light.” – This prompt uses cinema:c keywords 
(composi:on, wide-angle, lens ﬂare), descrip:ve imagery, and a grand camera move 
to evoke a ﬁlm scene. 
Animated or Cartoon-Style Videos 
To create outputs that look like anima:ons or cartoons (rather than realis:c footage), adjust 
your prompt wording to emphasize illustra:on and animated quali:es: 

•  Specify the Anima2on Style: Use terms like “3D animaMon”, “Pixar-like CGI”, “Disney 
cartoon style”, “2D anime style”, “stop-moMon claymaMon” depending on what you 
want. For example, “a scene in the style of a hand-drawn Studio Ghibli animaMon” or 
“Pixar style 3D characters with big eyes”. This immediately tells Kling you’re not 
aiming for strict realism. 

•  Exaggerate and Simplify: Animated visuals oZen have exaggerated features or 

simpliﬁed textures. You can men:on this: “caricatured proporMons”, “bright ﬂat 
colors, minimal texture”, “outline drawing”, etc. For a cartoon, you might say “cel-
shaded look with bold outlines”. For clayma:on, “slightly jerky, stop-moMon feel, with 
handcra.ed look”. 

•  Color and Ligh2ng: Cartoons oZen use vibrant, clean colors. Use adjec:ves like 

“vibrant, colorful” or speciﬁc paleMe cues like “pastel cartoon paleLe”. Ligh:ng in 
anima:on can be more stylized (e.g. “even lighMng, no dramaMc shadows” for a ﬂat 
cartoon, or “high contrast comic-book shading” for a graphic novel look). 

•  Movement Style: If you want the mo:on to feel animated, you could specify “bouncy 

movement”, “cartoon physics”, or “smooth 2D animaMon at 12fps” (tradi:onal 
anima:on oZen animated on twos). For example, “the character runs in place with a 
comical, exaggerated cycle”. Kling might not perfectly simulate frame rate, but 
indica:ng “animated feel” can inﬂuence the result. 

•  Avoiding Unwanted Realism: Use nega:ve prompts to remove realis:c ar:facts. For 
instance, if Kling tends to make things too real, put “photorealisMc, realisMc skin 
texture, live-acMon” in the nega:ve prompt. That encourages the model to s:ck to a 
purely animated look. 

•  Example Prompt (Cartoon): “A playful 2D animated scene of a cat and mouse chasing 

each other in a kitchen. Bright, saturated colors and bold black outlines on 
characters. The moMon is exaggerated and bouncy, with cartoon dust clouds when 
they zoom by. Sta/c camera framing the scene like a classic cartoon shot.” – Here we 
clearly asked for 2D anima:on with outlines, vivid colors, exaggerated/bouncy 
mo:on, and even speciﬁed a sta:c camera to mimic how classic cartoons oZen have 
the background sta:c while characters move within the frame. 

•  Example Prompt (Anime style): “An anime-style video of a futurisMc city. The 

heroine’s hair and coat ﬂuLer drama/cally as she stands on a skyscraper ledge. 
Dynamic anime ac/on lines and streaked mo/on as a ﬂying car rushes past. Cel-
shaded look with high-contrast shadows, and the background painted in detailed 
neon city lights.” – This mixes content (futuris:c city, heroine) with anime-speciﬁc 
cues (ac:on lines, cel-shading, high contrast shadow style). 

Stylized Ar2s2c Videos 
“Stylized” videos refer to outputs with a dis:nc:ve art style or crea:ve visual twist – for 
example, a video that looks like an oil pain:ng come to life, or a surreal dream sequence with 
distorted reality. To prompt these: 

•  Pick an Art Medium or Style: Iden:fy if you want it to look like a pain:ng, sketch, 
sculpture, etc. E.g. “watercolor painMng style”, “oil painMng style with visible 
brushstrokes”, “chalk drawing animaMon”, “stained glass look”. Kling can oZen mimic 
art mediums if described clearly. “A video in the style of a Van Gogh painMng” (i.e. 
swirling impressionist strokes) is possible, though if referencing a speciﬁc ar:st, the 
results can vary and the system might avoid explicit famous ar:st copying – but 
generic art style descrip:ons work well. 

•  Surreal or Abstract Elements: If you want a dreamlike or abstract vibe, say so. 

“surreal atmosphere, objects morph slowly”, “melMng clocks and ﬂoaMng islands (in a 
nod to Dali)” – you can be quite imagina:ve. Kling 2.0 is capable of moderate 
surrealism, especially if your prompt guides it through transi:ons or morphing. But 
note that extreme abstract sequences might be challenging to control; you may need 
to experiment with diﬀerent phrasings or possibly generate as mul:ple segments. 

•  Color and Form: Stylized outputs oZen emphasize certain colors or forms. For 

example: “monochromaMc paleLe in red tones”, or “high-contrast black and white ink 
drawing style”. You could also specify geometry like “in a low-poly 3D style” for a 
stylized CGI look. 

•  Movement for Stylized Videos: If the style is like a pain:ng, you might keep 

movement gentle or minimal so the frame looks like art with slight mo:on (like a 
cinemagraph). For instance, “a living watercolor painMng of a seaside – camera 
locked sta/c, only the water waves and clouds move with a gentle painted eﬀect.” On 
the other hand, if it’s a bold style, you can add “dramaMc transiMons” like “the scene 
splashes into new colors as the mood shi.s” (though Kling might not interpret 
“splashes into new colors” literally, it sets the expecta:on of a color-changing eﬀect). 
•  Combine with Nega2ve Prompts: Nega:ves can remove realism or certain unwanted 
details. If you want a clean cartoonish style, you might negate “texture, detail” (to 
avoid realis:c skin pores or such). If you want an old pain:ng style, you might negate 
“modern objects” to avoid anything anachronis:c. 

•  Example Prompt (Ar2s2c Styliza2on): “A surreal, dreamlike video of a desert where 
the sand dunes ﬂow like waves. Painted oil-pain/ng style with visible brushstrokes 
on the moving sand. The sky is swirling with purple and orange hues in an 
impressionis/c manner. Slow, poe/c camera pan, as shapes in the sand subtly morph 
into silhoueLes of animals and then back into dunes.” – This prompt tells Kling to 
produce an ar:s:c, painterly look with surreal morphing elements. We set a slow 
pace and included plenty of art-style descriptors (oil pain:ng, brushstrokes, 
impressionis:c). 

•  Example Prompt (Minimalist Graphic Style): “A minimalis/c ﬂat-design animaMon of 
a city skyline. Buildings are simple shapes in solid colors. No gradients or textures 
(ﬂat colors only). Smooth mo/on of a rising sun icon above the skyline. The style is 
like a moving infographic, very clean and modern.” – Here we explicitly negated 
textures, asked for ﬂat design, and described the simpliﬁed style to get a stylized 
outcome. 
Product-Focused Videos 
When showcasing a product (for an adver:sement or demo), the prompt should emphasize 
the product and its features, ensuring clarity and appeal. Kling 2.0 can make great product 
shots if guided properly: 

•  Foreground the Product: Start the scene descrip:on with the product as the main 

subject. E.g. “A sleek smartphone ﬂoaMng in mid-air” or “A pair of running shoes on a 
rotaMng plalorm”. Make it clear the product is center-stage, not a :ny part of a 
bigger scene. 

•  Simple, Clean Background: OZen for product videos, less is more in the background. 
You can explicitly men:on the background: “on a solid white backdrop”, “in a minimal 
studio se[ng”, or “on a simple wooden table with blurred background”. This ensures 
the model doesn’t cluMer the scene with unrelated elements. If you want some 

• 

environment (like the product in a lifestyle seRng), keep it controlled: “a watch 
placed on a rock by a waterfall (to imply ruggedness), with the waterfall so.ly blurred 
behind”. 
Ligh2ng to Highlight the Product: Good product shots have great ligh:ng. You might 
say “studio so.box lighMng illuminaMng the product evenly” or “dramaMc spotlight 
from above” for a more ar:s:c product shot. Describe reﬂec:ons or highlights if 
applicable: “the boLle has a subtle highlight along its side”. For reﬂec:ve products, 
men:on “reﬂecMve surface” or “glossy ﬁnish reﬂecMng light”. For tech gadgets, 
maybe “cool-toned lighMng for a sleek look”. 

•  Mo2on Showcasing Features: The camera movement should show oﬀ the product 

details: 

o  A common approach is a 360° rota2on or an orbit: e.g. “camera slowly rotates 

360° around the sneaker, showing all angles”blog.segmind.com. 

o  Or “the product itself rotates”: e.g. “the camera stays staMc while the watch 

spins to reveal its sides”. 

o  Zooms can highlight features: “slow zoom in to the phone’s screen to show the 

o 

display”. 
If mul:ple features, you might need mul:ple shots (or generate separate 
videos focusing on each feature, then edit). In a single prompt, you could try: 
“First, a wide shot of the laptop, then a close-up on its keyboard”, but this may 
be too complex for one genera:on – it might blur those into one scene. If 
aMempted, ensure transi:onal phrasing like “camera cuts to a close-up of the 
keyboard”, though there's no guarantee Kling will do an actual cut. It might be 
beMer to generate two clips. 

•  Clarity and Quality: Use adjec:ves that imply sharpness and quality, such as “ultra-
detailed, high-deﬁniMon, crisp focus”. Also ensure in nega:ve prompts to remove 
anything that could mar the quality (e.g. “blurry, grainy”). For product shots, you 
likely want “clean” output: so nega:ve prompt could include “dirt, scratches” unless 
the product is supposed to be dirty or rugged. 

•  Stylish Presenta2on: If it’s a luxury item, add “luxurious lighMng” or “dramaMc 
shadows under it for a premium look”. If it’s a tech item, maybe “futurisMc 
holographic eﬀects around it”. Tailor the style to the product’s brand image (modern, 
playful, eco-friendly, etc., with appropriate descriptors). 

•  Example Prompt (Product Showcase): “Scene: A white ceramic coﬀee mug is 

centered on a glossy black marble countertop in a minimalist 
kitchenblog.segmind.com. Style: So. studio lighMng from the side highlights the 
mug’s texture, with warm tones matching a morning mood. Mo/on: The camera 
slowly orbits 360° around the mug, pausing brieﬂy to focus on the printed logo, then 
conMnuing aroundblog.segmind.com. The background is so.ly blurred, keeping the 
mug in sharp focus.” – This prompt clearly deﬁnes the product and seRng, uses 
appropriate ligh:ng, and a smooth showcasing mo:on. (Note: We structured it with 
“Scene: … Style: … Mo:on: …” just for clarity here, but you can write it as full 
sentences in actual use.) 

•  Example Prompt (Tech Product): “A new smartphone ﬂoats in a dark void. Studio rim 
ligh/ng outlines its silhoueLe and so; front light reveals its screen. The phone slowly 
rotates to show its front and back. Cinema/c glow on the edges, and a blue techy 
background light faintly shines behind. The camera gently zooms in as it rotates, 

emphasizing the ultra-slim proﬁle.” – A typical tech ad style: dark background, 
drama:c ligh:ng, rota:ng product, slight zoom for emphasis. 

Using Kling 2.0 for product videos can yield impressive results if you focus the prompt on the 
product and keep everything else minimal and suppor:ve of itblog.segmind.com. Always 
review if the model added any unwanted text or extra objects on the product (some:mes AI 
might put nonsense logos – use nega:ve prompts like “text” to avoid that). 
Natural Scenes and Landscapes 
Natural scenes (like landscapes, wildlife, weather phenomena) require a slightly diﬀerent 
approach. Consistency and realism are key to avoid weird glitches (like objects morphing). 
Here’s how to prompt for nature: 

•  Describe the Environment in Detail: Nature can be expansive, so set the scene 

thoroughly. If it’s a landscape, men:on terrain features (mountains, rivers, trees, 
etc.), sky condi:ons, and ligh:ng. For example: “a lush green valley with rolling hills, a 
river snaking through the center, and a misty mountain range in the distance under a 
dawn sky”. This gives Kling a lot to render. If focusing on a speciﬁc natural subject 
(like a single tree or animal in its habitat), you can narrow in on that but s:ll men:on 
the surroundings: “a close-up shot of a sunﬂower ﬁeld on a sunny day, bees buzzing 
around the blossoms, distant hills under a clear blue sky”. 

•  Use Scenic Adjec2ves: Words like majesMc, tranquil, rugged, prisMne help convey the 
feeling. If you want a cinema2c nature documentary feel, say “documentary style 
footage of ...” or “NaMonal Geographic-like scene of ...”. This may encourage realis:c, 
stable output. 

•  Camera Sugges2ons: OZen, wide steady shots or gentle pans work well for nature: 

o  “slow panoramic pan across the desert at sunset”, 
o  “steady aerial drone shot over the forest canopy”, 
o  “Mme-lapse steady shot of a ﬂower blooming”. 

For wildlife ac:on, you could do “camera tracks the eagle as it soars”, but 
keep in mind complex animal mo:on might be hit-or-miss. Simpler is safer: 
“the eagle glides across the sky, camera follows from behind”. 

•  Weather and Time of Day: These hugely aﬀect the visuals. Include them if relevant: 
“a rainforest in the rain with raindrops paLering on leaves”, or “a beach at golden 
hour with orange-pink sky colors reﬂecMng on the water”. If you want dynamic 
weather changes (like day to night), you might need separate prompts or the 
start/end frame feature. It’s tough to have one short video smoothly change from 
noon to night without an explicit feature. 

•  Stability and Consistency: Nature scenes can some:mes suﬀer from ﬂicker if too 
many elements are moving or changing (like lots of animals or complex water 
reﬂec:ons). To avoid this: 

o  Don’t overload the prompt with many diﬀerent moving parts; focus on a few 

key elements. 

o  Use sta2c camera if appropriate, which oZen yields more stable imagery of 

o 

landscapes (since the frame isn’t also moving). 
If your scene has repe::ve paMerns (like a forest of many trees or a ﬂock of 
birds), AI might struggle to keep them consistent. You can mi:gate this by not 
emphasizing the number, or using phrases like “vast forest” (implied many 
trees but not individually tracked). Kling is quite advanced, but it’s s:ll 
genera:ve – minor con:nuity oddi:es can happen. 

•  Example Prompt (Landscape): “A grand panoramic view of the Swiss Alps at dawn. 
Snow-capped peaks glow as the ﬁrst sunlight of day hits them. Camera is sta/c, 
showing a valley below with a winding river reﬂecMng the pink sky. So; clouds hang 
around the mountain tops, slowly dissipa/ng as the sky brightens. The scene is serene 
and majes/c, with crystal clear details.” – This prompt sets a speciﬁc place (Alps at 
dawn) and uses terms to ensure a stable, beau:ful shot (sta:c camera, clear details, 
slow movement of clouds only). 

•  Example Prompt (Wildlife close-up): “A close-up, documentary-style shot of a lioness 
walking through golden savanna grass. Shallow depth of ﬁeld keeps the focus on her 
face while the background is a so. blur of grass. Natural ligh/ng of late a.ernoon 
sun casts a warm glow on her fur. Camera tracks gently alongside her at eye level as 
she moves gracefully.” – This describes a natural animal scene with cinema:c 
documentary feel (close-up, shallow DOF, tracking camera, warm natural light). It also 
implicitly avoids quick cuts or anything unnatural. 

Use nega:ve prompts in nature scenes for things like “blurry, ﬂicker” if needed, or if the AI 
some:mes introduces human structures or animals you didn’t ask for (e.g. nega:ng “people” 
or certain animals if they keep appearing unwanted). 
Sci-Fi and Fantasy Scenes 
Sci-ﬁ (science ﬁc:on) and fantasy prompts allow you to really ﬂex crea:ve descrip:ons. Kling 
2.0 can generate futuris:c ci:es, mythical creatures, and imagina:ve worlds with the right 
cues: 

•  Use Imagina2ve Detail: Don’t shy away from inven:ng details. Sci-ﬁ city? Describe 

neon signs, ﬂying vehicles, towering skyscrapers, maybe mul:ple moons or futuris:c 
tech. Fantasy forest? Describe bioluminescent plants, magical creatures, ethereal light 
rays. For example: “a sprawling cyberpunk city at night, with hovering cars zipping 
between neon-lit skyscrapers and giant holographic billboards in the sky”. Or “an 
ancient ﬂoa/ng island in the sky with waterfalls spilling into the clouds below, and 
dragons circling its craggy peaks”. The more vividly you paint the scene, the beMer 
Kling can aMempt to visualize it. 
Incorporate Genre Keywords: Words like futurisMc, cyberpunk, dystopian, utopian, 
alien, magical, ethereal, steampunk immediately set a tone. For sci-ﬁ, men:oning 
technology or advanced materials (holographic, nanotech, robo:c) can help. For 
fantasy, invoking magic or mythical elements (ancient rune-covered stones, 
shimmering spells) is useful. 
Ligh2ng and Color for Eﬀect: Sci-ﬁ oZen has bold ligh:ng – e.g. neon blues, reds, 
holographic glows. Fantasy might have more natural but intensiﬁed ligh:ng – e.g. 
glowing orbs, mys:cal moonlight. Tailor it: “pulsaMng neon lights and holograms” for 
sci-ﬁ, versus “so. enchanted forest glow with ﬂoaMng parMcles” for fantasy. These 
touches add atmosphere. 

• 

• 

•  Camera and Mo2on in Sci-ﬁ/Fantasy: Both genres can beneﬁt from dynamic camera 

work: 

o  Sci-ﬁ ac:on: “the camera dives between skyscrapers following a ﬂying car”, 
or “Zero-G perspecMve, camera rolls as the astronaut tumbles in space”. 

o  Fantasy epic: “sweeping aerial shot over the fantasy kingdom”, “dramaMc orbit 

o 

around the dragon as it takes ﬂight”. 
If a lot is happening (like a baMle), you might describe one con:nuous mo:on 
that captures it, or consider spliRng scenes. 

o  First-person view can be cool in sci-ﬁ (e.g. FPV of a mech suit running, or an 

alien’s POV). 

o  For more surreal fantasy, a slower, smooth camera might let the viewer soak 

in the environment details. 

•  Consistency of Design: One challenge: ensuring all elements ﬁt the same world. If 

you men:on “robot” and “wizard” in one scene, it will try to mix them (which might 
be ﬁne if that’s the intent). But generally, keep your theme cohesive. All futuris:c 
tech, or all medieval magic – unless your concept is explicitly a mashup. 
•  Example Prompt (Sci-Fi City): “A futuris/c sci-ﬁ cityscape at night, ﬁlled with 

towering skyscrapers and giant holographic adverMsements. Flying vehicles zip 
through the sky lanes between buildings. Rain-soaked streets reﬂect the neon signs. 
The camera glides forward at street level, smoothly weaving through traﬃc. 
Cyberpunk atmosphere with vibrant blues and pinks, and steam rising from vents.” – 
This packs in a lot of cyberpunk detail: neon, rain reﬂec:ons, ﬂying cars, etc., with a 
smooth camera mo:on to set a scene like a movie opening. 

•  Example Prompt (Fantasy Scene): “In a magical forest clearing, a unicorn stands by a 
tranquil pool under the full moon. Fireﬂies dri; in the air leaving Mny light trails. The 
scene has a so; blue glow with mist hugging the ground. Camera slowly pans 
around the unicorn, capturing the sparkling horn and the ancient glowing runes on 
the surrounding trees. The mood is otherworldly and serene.” – This describes a 
fantasy environment with magical elements, speciﬁes gentle mo:on, and maintains a 
consistent enchanted mood. 

•  Nega2ve Prompts for Sci-Fi/Fantasy: If the model tends to insert things like random 
text or unwanted anachronisms, negate them (e.g. “text” if signs have gibberish, or 
“cars” if you want pure medieval fantasy and it keeps throwing a car in the distance!). 
Also, for highly detailed scenes, some:mes ar:facts might appear – nega:ng “glitch, 
distor:on” can help if you see any. 

Sci-ﬁ and fantasy prompts can be some of the most fun – let your imagina:on lead, and use 
the prompt to communicate that vivid mental image to Kling. The more clearly you describe 
the crea:ve elements, the beMer the chance the model will include them. 
Chaining Prompts for Mul2-Scene or Story-Based Videos 
Kling 2.0 (like most AI video models) typically generates a short clip for a given prompt. If you 
want to create a longer video with mul:ple scenes (for example, telling a short story with a 
beginning, middle, and end, or just a sequence of diﬀerent shots), you will need to chain 
prompts – essen:ally, create mul:ple clips and combine them, or use Kling’s advanced 
features to transi:on between scenes. 
Here are strategies for mul:-scene videos: 

•  Sequen2al Genera2on: The straighIorward approach is to plan out your scenes and 
generate them one by one. Write a separate prompt for each scene. Ensure each 
scene’s prompt is self-contained and focused. For example, if you want a 3-scene 
story (Scene1: character waking up, Scene2: character running in park, Scene3: 
character at night looking at stars), you’d generate three clips: 

1.  Prompt for Scene 1 – e.g. “Morning light spills into a bedroom. A man wakes 
up and stretches by the window. Camera staMc, so. warm light, calm mood.” 
2.  Prompt for Scene 2 – e.g. “Now outside, the man jogs through a city park with 
trees swaying. Camera follows from the side, energeMc morning atmosphere.” 

3.  Prompt for Scene 3 – e.g. “At night, the man stands on a hill under a starry sky, 

gazing upwards. SilhoueLe shot, cool blue moonlight, peaceful vibe.” 

Each is generated separately. Then you can edit these clips together in post-processing 
(manually outside of Kling). Tip: To make the transi:ons feel smooth, you can try to have a 
linking element (like end Scene2 with him looking up, start Scene3 with sky, etc.). 

•  Using Start/End Frames (Transi2on within one clip): Kling’s advanced Start/End 
Frame feature allows you to specify a star:ng image and an ending image for one 
video, and the AI will generate frames transi:oning between thempollo.ai. This is one 
way to do a two-part scene in a single clip (e.g. start in Scene A, end in Scene B 
seamlessly). For example, you could upload an image of your character in loca:on A 
and another image of the character in loca:on B; Kling will animate a transi:on from 
A to B. When using this: 

o  Keep Scenes Related: The start and end should be somewhat similar in 
composi:on or content to avoid bizarre morphingpollo.ai. For instance, 
transi:oning from a close-up face to a wide landscape might not turn out well. 
But transi:oning from one landscape to another, or one pose to another, can 
work if done carefully. 

o  Prompt for the Transi2on: You s:ll provide a prompt describing the overall 
transforma:on or mo:on that connects the two states. E.g. “Start frame: a 
closed ﬂower bud; End frame: the ﬂower fully bloomed. Prompt: a Mme-lapse 
of a rose blooming in sunlight”. Kling will try to go from the bud image to the 
bloom image over the clippollo.ai. This is great for transformaMons or scene 
changes like season change, object morphs, etc. 

o  Limit to Two Scenes: Start/end frame method eﬀec:vely can handle one 

transi:on (A to B). If you need mul:ple transi:ons (A to B to C), you’d have to 
chain mul:ple clips (A->B, then B->C, etc. as separate genera:ons). 
•  Video Extension and Mul2-Elements: Kling also has features like Video Extension (to 
make a clip longer by con:nuing it) and Mul2-Elements (to add or remove elements 
in a video)pollo.aipollo.ai. In the context of promp:ng: 

o  Video Extension: If you have a clip and want to con:nue the ac:on beyond its 
original dura:on, you might use the extension feature with a new prompt to 
carry on. This is a form of chaining where the end of the ﬁrst clip becomes the 
start of the next segment. The beneﬁt is maintaining con:nuity (less jump 
between clips). For instance, generate a 5s clip of Scene1. Then use the last 
frame of Scene1 as the start for Scene2 (via the start frame feature, or Kling’s 
internal memory if using extension) and prompt what happens next. This way, 
Scene2 begins exactly where Scene1 leZ oﬀ. The UI might allow directly 
extending with a prompt, or you might simulate it by extrac:ng the last frame 
and using it as an image input for the next genera:on. 

o  MulM-Elements for Consistency: With Kling’s Elements tool (currently in Kling 

1.6 for complex editslandofgeek.com), advanced users can composite mul:ple 
characters or objects to ensure consistency. For example, you could generate 
a character in one scene, then import that same character image into another 
scene as an element to keep their appearance iden:callandofgeek.com. This is 
quite advanced and oZen not purely prompt-based (it involves the UI where 
you highlight and replace elements). But it’s good to know if you need two 
characters to persist across scenes without change. 

o  MoMon Brushes: Another advanced tool – if you plan to chain within one 

scene, the mo2on brush can set speciﬁc paths for objects or sta:c regions to 
hold s:llpollo.ai. For a story, perhaps less relevant unless you are doing 
complex mul:-character interac:ons. 

•  Maintaining Narra2ve Consistency: If you want the same character or object to 

appear in mul:ple scenes, be consistent in your descrip:ons: 

o  Use the same keywords for them each :me (e.g. “the man with the red 

o 

jacket” – repeat that in each prompt, so Kling tries to keep him red-jacketed). 
If possible, use an image of that character as a star:ng point for each scene 
(image-to-video advantage). For example, generate a good portrait of your 
character ﬁrst, then feed that as the image for various scenes of the story, 
changing only the background and ac:on in prompts. This can signiﬁcantly 
improve consistency of the character’s face/ouIit across scenes. 

o  Keep the art style the same across scenes (as men:oned earlier) unless the 

story inten:onally changes style. 

o  Accept that perfect con:nuity (like the exact same face or exact same layout 
persis:ng) can be tricky with genera:ve AI. Minor diﬀerences might occur. 
Clever use of images and prompts can minimize it, but a 100% match is hard. 
S:ll, many users achieve visually consistent results by reusing reference 
images. 

•  Transi2ons Between Scenes: AI won’t automa:cally add a transi:on eﬀect (like a 

fade or cut) when you join clips. That’s something you do in edi:ng aZer. However, 
you can design the last frame of one clip and the ﬁrst frame of the next to be similar 
for an in-scene cut. For example, end Scene1 prompt with “…camera turns towards 
the door as it opens” and start Scene2 prompt with “Through the door, now in the 
next room, …”. When you cut those together, the viewer’s eye follows the door 
transi:on. This requires manual planning and maybe trial to get the last frame you 
want. 
Length and Cuts: If you try to cram too much into a single 5-10 second genera:on 
(like 3 diﬀerent mini-scenes), the AI might produce a muddled result with ﬂickering as 
it tries to morph between unrelated scenes quickly. It’s beMer to keep each generated 
clip focused on one scene or con:nuous ac:on. Quick cuts (like a fast-paced music 
video style) are best done by genera:ng mul:ple short clips and cuRng them 
externally, rather than one genera:on with a super complex prompt. 
Example of a Chained Story: Imagine a short story of a girl ﬁnding a magic sword: 

• 

•  Scene 1 Prompt: “A young girl in ragged clothes walks through a dense forest at 

dusk, looking weary. Camera follows from front as she pushes past branches. Faint 
rays of light ﬁlter through trees.” (Generate 5s clip.) 

•  Scene 2 Prompt (next scene, new clip): “She enters an ancient ruined temple covered 
in vines. In the center, a sword is embedded in a stone. Camera pans from her face (in 
awe) to the glowing sword. Dust parMcles ﬂoat in the torchlight.” (Generate clip.) 
•  Scene 3 Prompt: “She grasps the sword and pulls it out. Bright light erupts from the 
stone as the temple shakes. Close-up shot of her determined face lit by the magical 
glow. Rocks start falling as she holds the sword alo..” (Generate clip.) 

•  Scene 4 Prompt: “Outside the temple, night has fallen. The girl stands atop the temple 
stairs with the sword shining, full moon behind her. Epic wide shot as she raises the 

sword, beams of light shooMng into the sky, signifying the prophecy is fulﬁlled.” 
(Generate ﬁnal clip.) 

AZer genera:ng each, you’d s:tch them. To improve con:nuity, you could: 

•  Use the last frame of Scene 1 (her approaching temple) as the start frame image for 

Scene 2 genera:on. 

•  Ensure the sword’s look is similar in scenes 2–4 (perhaps take an image from scene 2 
of the sword and include it if needed, or consistently describe it like “glowing blue 
runed sword” each :me). 

•  Keep the ligh:ng/:me consistent from end of scene 3 to start of scene 4 (in this story, 
scene 4 jumps to outside at night, which is an inten:onal drama:c transi:on, so it’s 
ﬁne being diﬀerent). 

Chaining prompts requires some experimenta:on. You might regenerate a scene if it doesn’t 
match well with the previous. But with prac:ce, you can create impressive mul:-shot 
sequences. 
Best Prac2ces for Realism, Styliza2on, and Consistency 
Finally, let’s summarize some best prac:ces to get the most out of Kling 2.0 and avoid 
common mistakes, whether you want photorealis:c videos or wildly stylized ones: 

•  Clarity and Focus: Always aim for clarity in your prompt. Clearly separate the subject, 
ac:on, and seRng in your descrip:on. Keep each prompt focused on a few main 
ideas (experts suggest 2–4 key points maximum) to avoid confusing the 
modellearn.rundiﬀusion.com. If you ﬁnd yourself wri:ng a paragraph with ten 
diﬀerent clauses, consider spliRng into mul:ple prompts/scenes or simplifying the 
scene. 

•  Don’t Overload with Adjec2ves: While details are good, packing too many adjec:ves 
or style tags can backﬁre. For example, “a beauMful, stunning, highly detailed, ultra-
realisMc, professional, award-winning photograph of X” is overkill and some terms 
conﬂict or are too abstract (“beauMful” is subjec:ve and can confuse the 
AIblog.segmind.com). Instead, pick a couple of strong, speciﬁc descriptors: e.g. “so. 
natural morning light and sharp focus” conveys beauty in a concrete way, rather than 
just saying “beau:ful ligh:ng.”blog.segmind.com 

•  Avoid Conﬂic2ng Instruc2ons: As men:oned, ensure all parts of your prompt work 
together. PiIall examples: asking for “fast-paced ac:on in dreamy slow mo:on” 
(choose one), or “ultra-realis:c cartoon” (oxymoron). If you inadvertently include 
opposites, Kling will struggleblog.segmind.com. Decide on one style per scene or ﬁnd 
a phrasing that actually makes sense (e.g. “a realisMc scene with a dreamlike 
atmosphere” could work if you mean realis:c rendering with foggy ligh:ng, but be 
careful). 

•  Consistent Terminology for Consistent Output: Use the same names for things each 
:me. If in one sentence you call the subject “a young boy” and later “the child” and 
later “the teenager,” the model might think they are diﬀerent en::es. S:ck to one 
term (unless you mean diﬀerent things). This is especially important if genera:ng 
mul:ple scenes – refer to your main character the same way each :me. Also, if you 
want a mo:f or object to persist (like a “red balloon”), men:on it whenever needed 
so the AI knows it should be there. 
Leverage High Relevance (Prompt Weight): Kling presumably has some internal 
prompt adherence seRng (some UIs call it “relevance” or “guidance scale”). If you 
ﬁnd Kling is not following the prompt strictly (maybe wandering oﬀ topic), check if 

• 

you can increase prompt strength. In Kling’s interface there might be a slider for how 
strongly it s:cks to your descrip:on. Users have found that maximizing this can yield 
more prompt-loyal resultsytscribe.com, though it might reduce crea:vity slightly. If 
the op:on is available (e.g. “Professional mode” vs “Standard mode”), experiment 
with it. Note: This is more of a soZware seRng than promp:ng, but it’s part of best 
prac:ces to get the output you want. 

•  Use Reference Images for Realism: If you have a target style or subject, consider 

providing a reference image (if the plaIorm supports it) in addi:on to your prompt. 
For instance, if you want a speciﬁc actor’s likeness or a speciﬁc art style, a reference 
can guide Kling. Promp:ng alone might not exactly nail a famous face or a unique art 
style due to limita:ons on using exact names, but a reference image can legally and 
eﬀec:vely provide that guidance. Make sure you have rights to any image you use as 
reference. 
Itera2ve Reﬁnement: Rarely will a complex scene come out perfect on the ﬁrst try. 
Expect to reﬁne. Maybe your ﬁrst output is too dark – so add “brighten ligh:ng” or 
remove “night”. Or the camera moved too much – next :me specify “sta:c camera” 
or “steady shot”. If an unwanted element appears, add it to nega:ves. Treat each 
genera:on as a feedback loop to improve your prompt wording. This is normal even 
for advanced users. 

• 

•  Avoiding Pioalls with Nega2ve Prompts: We’ve covered nega:ve prompts, but as a 
best prac:ce: Always check if an odd ar:fact or element appears and then update 
your nega:ve list. Common piIalls might be: 

o  Flicker or frame inconsistencies: Harder to control via prompt, but some:mes 
caused by too many conﬂic:ng style elements. Simplifying the prompt or 
using nega:ve terms like “ﬂicker” or “unstable” may or may not help (stability 
is oZen more about the model’s internals). If ﬂicker is severe, try a shorter 
dura:on or a simpler scene. 

o  Text or Logos appearing uninten2onally: Include “text, watermark, logo, 

numbers” in nega:ve prompt if you see any AI-generated text on signs or such 
– the model some:mes does this especially in city scenes or products. 
o  Uncanny or distorted details: If faces look weird, you can try nega:ve terms 
like “deformed, distorted, disﬁgured” though Kling 2.0 is quite advanced and 
usually handles faces well if prompted clearly. If the distor:on persists, 
consider a diﬀerent approach (like providing an ini:al image of the face, or 
changing the angle/ligh:ng). 

o  Model Misinterpre2ng a Word: If you use a word that has mul:ple meanings, 
the AI might pick the wrong one. For example “bark” (could be a dog bark or 
tree bark). If you got a dog and you meant tree, clarify in prompt (e.g. “tree 
bark texture” vs “a dog barking”). In case of such misﬁres, reword with more 
context. 

•  Realism Tips: For highly realis:c videos, lean on photographic terms in your prompt: 
“4K detail, photorealisMc, realisMc lighMng, cinemaMc grade”. Also ensure no stylis:c 
terms that contradict realism (e.g. remove “illustra:on” or “Pixar” references). Use 
nega:ve prompts to eliminate “cartoonish, CGI, pain:ng” if any hint of them appears. 
Addi:onally, realis:c mo:on is typically smooth and not too fast unless it’s an ac:on 
scene, so describe physics accurately (if something heavy moves, “slow and weighty 

movement” etc.). LiMle details like “wind rustling leaves” or “dust in sunlight” can add 
to realism because they are things a real camera might capture. 

•  Styliza2on Tips: For very stylized results, some:mes you need to actually ﬁght the 

model’s tendency to realism. This means heavily emphasizing the style: e.g. “en/rely 
in pencil sketch style, black and white, no shading except crosshatch, looks like a 
ﬂipbook drawing.” And as men:oned, nega:ve out realism. It might take a few tries 
to get a strong styliza:on – the model was trained on a lot of real footage, so pushing 
it to extreme art styles is possible but requires asser:ve promp:ng. If one approach 
doesn’t work, try analogies: instead of “in watercolor”, maybe “as if each frame is a 
watercolor pain:ng, colors soZly bleeding”. Some:mes a bit of poe:c descrip:on can 
nudge it in the right direc:on. 

•  Community Knowledge: Kling is evolving, and prompt techniques can change as 

models update. A best prac:ce is to stay connected with the community (Discord, 
forums) to learn new hacks or recommended phrases. For example, some users 
discover certain shorthand tags or internal model “styles” that work (like some 
models had things like “Unreal Engine style” or similar that triggers a look). Keep an 
eye out for Kling-speciﬁc discoveries shared by others, and feel free to experiment 
with those in your prompts. 

•  Pa2ence and Crea2vity: Finally, the best prac:ce is pa:ence and having fun with the 
crea:ve process. Genera:ng AI videos is part art, part trial-and-error. Some:mes 
you’ll get a gem on ﬁrst try; other :mes you’ll need to tweak the prompt mul:ple 
:mes. Use this guide as a star:ng point, but don’t hesitate to try wild ideas – you 
might be surprised by what Kling 2.0 can do! 

Common Pioalls and How to Avoid Them 
Even with the best guidelines, it’s easy to make some mistakes when craZing prompts. Here 
are common piIalls users encounter with Kling 2.0, and :ps to avoid them: 

1.  Vague or Short Prompts: Pilall: Providing a one-liner with hardly any detail (e.g. “a 
man on a beach” alone) will likely yield a very generic video. SoluMon: Add speciﬁc 
details about the man (appearance, ac:on) and the beach (:me of day, weather, 
camera shot)blog.segmind.com. Remember, be speciﬁc – if you don’t men:on it, 
Kling has to guess it. 

2.  Overly Complex Prompts: Pilall: Trying to describe an en:re movie in one prompt – 
for example, “A man is born, grows up, ﬁghts in a war, then becomes an astronaut 
and leaves Earth.” This is mul:ple scenes and too much for a single short video 
genera:on. Kling might mishmash these into something incoherent. SoluMon: Break 
story into mul:ple prompts/scenes. Focus each prompt on one key moment or 
con:nuous ac:on. Also, avoid run-on sentences with endless commas. If your prompt 
sentence is running very long, consider spliRng into two sentences or trimming less 
cri:cal descriptors. 

3.  Conﬂic2ng Style or Mo2on Instruc2ons: Pilall: Including incompa:ble styles (e.g. 
“hyper-realis:c cartoon” unless you speciﬁcally want a mix) or mo:ons (e.g. “sta:c 
camera and a rapid series of cuts” in one genera:on). The model can’t reconcile 
opposites wellblog.segmind.com. SoluMon: Decide on one approach per scene. If you 
want contrast (like a dreamy part and a frene:c part), do them as separate segments. 
Keep each prompt internally consistent in tone and technique. 

4.  Ambiguous Language and Filler Words: Pilall: Using words that are too abstract, like 
“make it beau:ful” or “something interes:ng happens” or “cool scene”. These don’t 

give concrete guidance and can confuse the AIblog.segmind.com. Or using ﬁller 
words like “a nice video of…” – the word “nice” doesn’t tell the model what to do. 
SoluMon: Replace abstract terms with descrip2ve imagery. Instead of “beau:ful 
landscape”, say “a breathtaking mountain landscape with vibrant wildﬂowers and a 
glowing sunset”blog.segmind.com. Instead of “cool eﬀect”, describe the eﬀect (e.g. “a 
slow-mo:on explosion of color” if that’s what you mean by cool). 

5.  Ignoring the Input Image Content (for image-to-video): Pilall: If using image-to-
video, a prompt that describes something completely unrelated to the image can 
cause bizarre outputs. For example, you feed in a photo of a cat and prompt “a 
spaceship ﬂying through space”. The model will struggle (it might morph the cat into 
a spaceship!). SoluMon: Either use an input image that matches the scene you want, 
or tailor the prompt to naturally extend the image. If you want to go far oﬀ (turn the 
cat photo into a spaceship scene), consider using the cat image only loosely (like as a 
texture or something) or beMer, just do text-to-video for that scenario. Leverage the 
image: men:on elements from it and how they change, rather than introducing 
en:rely new subjects out of the blue (unless that’s the eﬀect you want, like a surreal 
transforma:on, which should then be explicitly described as a transforma:on). 

6.  Not U2lizing Nega2ve Prompts (or using them incorrectly): Pilall: Some users forget 
the nega:ve prompt ﬁeld en:rely, and then get frustrated by recurring issues like 
blurriness or unwanted objects. Others try to put nega:ves in the main prompt (e.g. 
“no blur, no people”) which Kling will likely misinterpretreddit.com. SoluMon: Always 
consider if a nega:ve prompt can solve a problem. Use the separate ﬁeld to list 
undesirables clearly (as covered earlier). If Kling keeps doing something you don’t 
like, chances are a nega:ve prompt can address it. And remember, just list the term 
(e.g. “blur” or “people”) rather than phrasing “no X”pollo.ai. 

7.  Varying Character or Object Descrip2on: Pilall: If in one part of the prompt you call 
an important object “a red car” and later you call it “the vehicle” without specifying 
red, the model might change it (maybe the second :me it’s blue or a diﬀerent car). Or 
if you describe someone with certain features and then later describe them 
diﬀerently, the output might shiZ. SoluMon: For consistency, keep referring to cri:cal 
elements with the same descriptors each :me. Reinforce iden:ty: say “the red 
vintage car” each :me, not “the vehicle” on second reference (unless there’s only one 
vehicle and context is clear, but even then the AI might forget the detail). It can help 
to re-state key aMributes in subsequent sentences if needed, to remind the model. 

8.  A‘emp2ng Unfeasible Length or Aspect Ra2o via Prompt: Pilall: Wri:ng “a 30-

minute long video” or “split-screen view” or “ver:cal video format” in the prompt. 
The model is generally going to produce whatever length and format the system is set 
to (usually you select dura:on and aspect ra:o in seRngs, not via prompt). SoluMon: 
Use the tool’s interface to control length and aspect ra:o. Don’t rely on prompt to 
dras:cally change those. You can men:on “wide cinema:c frame” or “ver:cal 
smartphone view” if you want to hint at composi:on, but it’s not guaranteed to 
leMerbox or change aspect ra:o; it might just arrange content in a way that suggests 
it. For actual control, set the parameters outside of the prompt if available. 
9.  Expec2ng Perfect Speciﬁc Text or Numbers: Pilall: Promp:ng something like “a 

video of a phone showing the text ‘Hello World’ on screen” or “a person holds up 3 
ﬁngers (exactly three).” AI image/video models are notoriously bad at precise text (it 
will likely be gibberish) and can miscount limbs/ﬁngers. SoluMon: Avoid needing exact 

text in the video. If you must show an interface or sign, consider adding that later 
manually. If including it, use nega:ve prompt for “text” to avoid nonsense. For things 
like numbers of objects, some:mes sta:ng the number helps (e.g. “three wolves 
run…”) but be aware the AI might s:ll fudge it (maybe 2 or 4 show up). If the count is 
crucial, be prepared to iterate or adjust expecta:on. 

10. Not Reviewing and Learning: Pilall: Genera:ng once, geRng a bad result, and giving 
up or not analyzing why it was bad. SoluMon: Always review the output cri:cally: Did 
something odd happen at a certain point? Reread your prompt to see if maybe a 
word triggered it. Some:mes even a single word can have a strong inﬂuence (for 
example, “ﬂash” might inadvertently give a camera ﬂash eﬀect or a lightning ﬂash – 
context maMers). If you see an undesired element, think “did I men:on anything 
related to that?” If not, maybe it’s just the model’s crea:ve addi:on – then you know 
to explicitly nega:ve it next :me. Each genera:on is feedback. Use it to reﬁne your 
next prompt aMempt. 

By being mindful of these piIalls and ac:vely adjus:ng your promp:ng approach, you’ll 
signiﬁcantly improve your results with Kling 2.0. Promp:ng is a skill – it gets beMer with 
prac:ce, experimenta:on, and some:mes seeing how others prompt (and learning from 
their mistakes too). 

Conclusion: Promp:ng Kling 2.0 eﬀec:vely is about balancing detailed guidance with clear, 
crea:ve vision. Start simple and build up complexity as you get comfortable. Use the 
structure and :ps provided in this guide as a founda:on. Whether you’re aiming for a 
Hollywood-like clip, a whimsical cartoon, a stylish art piece, a polished product ad, a 
breathtaking nature shot, or a futuris:c adventure, Kling 2.0 can likely produce it with the 
right prompt (and maybe a liMle pa:ence). Keep reﬁning your prompts, u:lize features like 
nega:ve prompts and frame controls, and tap into the community for new ideas. Enjoy the 
process of bringing your ideas to life – with prac:ce, you’ll be “cas:ng spells” in Kling like a 
pro!
