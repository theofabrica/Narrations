1) What the model can (and can’t) do

ElevenLabs’ Sound Effects turns natural-language descriptions into sound design,
foley, ambiences, and even basic musical elements (e.g., drum loops, brass stabs).
It understands everyday language and audio terminology.

You control output with three key settings:
- Duration
- Looping
- Prompt influence

Max duration per generation is 30 seconds.
The UI can export MP3 (44.1 kHz) or WAV (48 kHz) and generates four candidates per run
for quick auditioning.

Parameters at a glance
- Duration: 0.1–30 s (set a fixed length or let the model decide)
- Looping: produces seamless loops for continuous beds and ambiences
- Prompt influence: controls adherence to text
  Higher = more literal
  Lower = more creative variation
  Default UI value = 30%

Complex sequences note:
For multi-event scenes, better results are achieved by generating components
separately and assembling them in a DAW, rather than prompting an entire scene
in one pass.


2) The Prompt Blueprint (recommended structure)

Use this “slots” template to keep prompts crisp, unambiguous, and reproducible:

[Core event] —
[Source / material] —
[Action / dynamics] —
[Environment / space] —
[Mic perspective & distance] —
[Timing / envelope] —
[Tone / texture] —
[Production / processing notes] —
[If musical: tempo / key / meter]

Example (impact):
Metal toolbox — dropped hard — concrete floor — small garage, tight reflections —
close-mic (0.5 m) — short decay, no reverb tail —
bright, crisp transient — no background noise.

Example (looping ambience):
Gentle forest rain — steady drizzle on leaves — light wind —
soft, diffuse space — mid-distance —
constant level, no swells —
warm noise floor — suitable for seamless looping.

The documentation explicitly encourages clear, concise nouns and audio terms such as:
“whoosh”, “impact”, “drone”, “braam”, “stem”, “loop”.


3) Picking settings that fit the job

Duration guidelines:
- One-shots & impacts: 0.3–1.5 s
- Whooshes & transitions: 1–3 s
- Foley actions (footsteps, etc.): 2–6 s per pass
- Ambiences & textures: 10–30 s (often with Looping enabled)

Ensure total duration does not exceed 30 s.

Looping:
Use for beds, ambiences, UI beds, engine idles, etc.
The engine is designed to produce seamless repeats.

Prompt influence:
- Raise above default (30%) when you need literal matches
- Lower for creative variation and texture exploration


4) Writing effective prompts (do’s & don’ts)

Do:
- Front-load the core noun (e.g., “glass shatter”, “wooden door creak”)
- Keep verbs specific (“slides”, “clacks”, “rattles”)
- Add material, surface, and space context
- Set mic perspective, envelope, and texture
- Split multi-part scenes into stems
- Specify BPM, key, and style for musical elements

Don’t:
- Stack contradictions (e.g., “bone-dry cathedral reverb”)
- Overload with narrative clutter
- Expect film-ready scenes from a single prompt


5) Pattern library (ready-to-use examples)

Impacts & hits:
- Thick wooden crate — dropped from 1 m — concrete floor —
  short, punchy thump — minimal rattle —
  close-mic (1 m) — tight room reflections.

- Cinematic braam — orchestral-brassy, sub-heavy —
  wide stereo — slow attack, long tail —
  ominous tone.

Whooshes & transitions:
- Airy whoosh — fast pass-by —
  soft high-end hiss — gentle swell —
  no tonal pitch — clean tail.

- Complex sci-fi whoosh — layered turbine spin-up then glide —
  subtle modulation — medium room.

Foley: footsteps
- Footsteps — leather boots on gravel —
  steady pace — small courtyard reflections —
  mid-distance — consistent level.

- Sneakers on polished wood —
  light squeaks — indoor gym —
  dry, close-mic.

Doors & mechanisms:
- Heavy metal door — latch clicks —
  slow creak open — hollow hallway resonance —
  close-mic on hinges.

- Mechanical lever — crisp click, spring recoil —
  precise, no hum.

UI & system sounds:
- Subtle UI tap — soft transient, short decay —
  warm, rounded tone — no reverb —
  phone OS style.

- Notification chime — two-note up-gliss —
  glassy but gentle — very short tail —
  clean.

Vehicles & pass-bys:
- Compact car pass-by — moderate speed —
  Doppler shift — suburban street ambience —
  mid-distance.

- Electric scooter whirr —
  steady idle — loop-ready —
  constant level — minimal hiss.

Weather & ambiences (Looping recommended):
- Light rain on leaves —
  steady drizzle — soft wind —
  diffuse canopy —
  loop-ready, no swells.

- City night ambience —
  distant traffic bed —
  occasional wet tire hiss —
  subtle neon buzz —
  even level.

Water:
- Single water droplet —
  ceramic sink —
  bright, resonant ping —
  short decay — ultra-clean.

- Stream trickle —
  small creek over stones —
  loop-ready —
  gentle stereo movement.

Electricity / tech / glitch:
- Analog static hiss —
  warm tape noise —
  gentle flutter —
  loop-ready.

- Glitchy data burst —
  stuttering packets —
  short, jagged transients —
  wide stereo image.

Magic / fantasy:
- Arcane spell cast —
  shimmering particles —
  upward whoosh —
  brief sparkle tail —
  no tonal center.

- Enchanted door unlock —
  crystalline twinkle + soft click —
  tiny chamber reverb.


6) Complex scenes: how to prompt and assemble

For sequences like:
“footsteps on gravel, then metallic door opens”,

Use explicit sequence words such as “then” or “followed by”.
For best control, render separate stems and assemble them later in your DAW.
This yields cleaner, more syncable results than a single monolithic prompt.


7) Musical elements with Sound Effects

You can prompt musical stems and loops:
- “90s hip-hop drum loop, 90 BPM”
- “Vintage brass stabs in F minor”

Specify:
- Tempo
- Key
- Feel
- Swing / quantization
- Tone (vinyl crackle, lo-fi tape)

For full songs, ElevenLabs provides a separate Music capability.


8) Looping technique (for seamless beds)

- Use phrasing such as “steady”, “constant level”, “no swells”
- Avoid distinct starts or endings
- Enable Looping in the UI for endless repetition


9) Workflow & quality checklist

1. Draft short and literal
2. Iterate to taste
3. Raise Prompt influence if the model drifts
4. Keep durations tight for one-shots
5. Audition the four generated variations
6. Download WAV 48 kHz for post
7. Layer stems and add fades in DAW


10) Cost-savvy prompting (UI & API)

Website UI:
- Auto length generation ≈ 200 credits
- Fixed duration ≈ 40 credits per second (max 30 s)

API:
- One effect per call
- Auto length ≈ 100 credits
- Fixed duration ≈ 20 credits per second

Tip:
Use short durations to audition, then extend once satisfied.


11) Troubleshooting quick fixes

- Too musical or pitched:
  Add “atonal”, “no musical pitch”

- Too noisy:
  Add “clean recording”, “low noise floor”,
  raise Prompt influence

- Scene feels messy:
  Split into stems, simplify wording, shorten duration

- Ambience doesn’t loop:
  Use “steady / no swells” phrasing and enable Looping


12) High-signal audio terms the model understands

Impact, whoosh, ambience, one-shot, loop, stem,
braam, glitch, drone


13) Community-validated tips

- Short-to-medium prompts outperform long prose
- Context (surface, space, perspective) resolves ambiguity
- Looping for beds, stems for scenes
