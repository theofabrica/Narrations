Knowledge Base – Prompting Music (Instrumental) for Eleven Music


0) Scope & Key Facts

- Eleven Music is a text-to-music model that understands natural-language and musical
  terminology, providing control over genre, structure, and whether vocals are present.

- It supports generating instrumental tracks (no sung vocals) when specified explicitly
  in the prompt. The UI supports durations from 10 seconds up to 5 minutes.

- By default, the model may include vocals or lyrics unless you explicitly indicate
  “instrumental only”.

- The product guide describes full workflows: generate, edit sections, refine styles,
  then export.

- Licensing and commercial use are permitted under certain subscription tiers.


1) What the Model Understands Especially Well

- Genre & mood:
  Responds to high-level moods (“melancholic”, “uplifting”) and detailed musical language
  (“dissonant strings over pulsing sub-bass”).

- Instrumentation, tempo, key:
  Specifying instruments, BPM (e.g., “120 BPM”), and key (“in A minor”) gives strong control.

- Structure & duration:
  Tracks can be built by sections (intro, verse, chorus, outro).
  Instrumental tracks still require “instrumental only”.

- Text with intent:
  The model considers use-case context (e.g., background for video, game trailer), and
  tailoring the prompt improves results.


2) The Building Blocks of an Effective Instrumental Prompt

When crafting a prompt for purely instrumental music, include:

1. Use Case / Context
   Example: background music for a tech product launch, short film soundtrack.

2. Genre & Sub-genre
   Example: ambient drone, cinematic orchestral, lo-fi hip-hop instrumental.

3. Instrumentation
   List instruments clearly; use “solo” when applicable (solo piano, solo guitar).

4. Tempo (BPM) & Key
   Example: 120 BPM, in D minor.

5. Texture & Production Style
   Analog warmth, wide stereo field, clean low end, long reverb, minimal beat.

6. Structure & Dynamics
   Describe evolution: build, crescendo, climax, decrescendo, fade-out.

7. Duration
   Specify total length or indicate loop-friendly format.

8. Exclusions / Negatives
   Explicitly state what you do not want:
   “no vocals”, “no choir”, “no vocal chops”, “no abrupt ending”.

9. Instrumental-Only Clause
   Always include “instrumental only” to guarantee no singing.


3) Ensuring “Instrumental Only”

- Add “instrumental only” in the prompt.

- When available in the API, use a parameter such as:
  force_instrumental = true

- To avoid ghost vocals or choir textures, also add exclusions:
  “Exclude: vocals, choir, vocal chops”.

- When working by sections, reinforce “instrumental only” per section if needed.


4) Duration, Structure & Variants

- Duration:
  UI supports fixed or auto duration.
  Minimum: 10 seconds
  Maximum: 5 minutes

- Structure:
  Recommended workflow:
  Start with a short section (intro), then add sections progressively.

- Variants:
  You can generate variants or regenerate individual sections for experimentation.

- Loop-friendly / endings:
  Specify “loop-friendly ending”, “no abrupt ending”, or “smooth fade-out”.


5) Style Negatives / Anti-Styles

To refine output further, exclude undesirable elements:

- Global exclusions:
  Example:
  “Exclude: vocals, choir, heavy electronic drums, four-on-the-floor kick”.

- Section-level exclusions:
  Example:
  Outro section — “Exclude: abrupt ending, vocals”.

- Use Include / Exclude style controls when available in the UI.


6) Composition Plan / Advanced Control

- The product guide mentions a composition plan (JSON) for advanced users.

- This plan can define:
  - Sections
  - Durations in milliseconds
  - Included styles
  - Excluded styles
  - Instrumentation per section

- Especially useful for precise timing (e.g., music synced to video edits).


7) Official Best Practices (Summary)

- Be specific with genre and style.
- Avoid vague labels like “rock music”.
- Layer descriptors: mood + instrumentation + use case + tempo.
- Define instrumentation clearly.
- Use Include / Exclude styles.
- Build by sections instead of generating long tracks at once.
- Iterate and refine instead of restarting from scratch.


8) Compliance & Limitations

- Prompt restrictions:
  Do not reference specific copyrighted artists, song titles, labels, or lyrics.

- Commercial use:
  Check your subscription tier for rights and limitations.

- Model limitations:
  Ambiguous prompts may still produce unexpected vocals or artifacts.

- Duration limits:
  Minimum 10 s, maximum 5 min per generation.


9) Prompt Templates (Instrumental)

Template A – Quick one-liner

[Use case], [genre/sub-genre], instrumental only,
[key instruments], [BPM], in [tonality],
[production texture], [duration],
Exclude: [unwanted elements].

Example:
“Product demo background music, indie-electro, instrumental only,
clean guitar + analog synth pads + warm bass,
112 BPM, in G major,
wide stereo field with crisp transients,
30 s,
Exclude: vocals, heavy distortion.”


Template B – Detailed brief

Describe role + genre + instrumentation + tempo/key +
texture/mix style + duration + exclusions.
End with: instrumental only.

Example:
“Instrumental only: ambient cinematic score for a short nature documentary.
Gentle strings, wind and water textures, soft piano motifs.
~70 BPM in D minor.
Large hall reverb, analog tape warmth, fade-out end.
Duration 60 s.
Exclude: vocals, choir, harsh percussion.”


Template C – Section by section (single prompt)

Instrumental only, total duration [X s].

- 0–10 s (Intro): instruments/texture, Include styles, Exclude elements.
- 10–40 s (Main): instruments, BPM, key, dynamics, Include/Exclude.
- 40–X s (Outro): reduced instrumentation, fade-out, Exclude abrupt stop.

Example:
“Instrumental only, 60 s.
0–15 s: solo piano, room ambience, no percussion.
15–45 s: string ensemble, 90 BPM, in B minor, building dynamics,
include subtle brass, exclude vocals and electronic drums.
45–60 s: fade to solo cello, long reverb tail, exclude abrupt stop.”

11) Iteration & Troubleshooting (Instrumental)

- Unexpected vocals:
  Reinforce “instrumental only” and add exclusions.

- Ambiguous style:
  Increase specificity (instrument, tempo, texture).

- Pacing issues:
  Define BPM and describe dynamic evolution.

- Abrupt ending:
  Specify “fade-out”, “clean tail”, or “loop-friendly”.

- Best practice:
  Build in sections and refine incrementally.
