Anatomy of Story

The Space and Time of the Story

Everyone knows how to tell stories. We all do it, every day. "You'll never guess what happened at work." Or: "Guess what I just did!" Or: "A guy walks into a bar and..." Throughout our lives, we see, hear, read, and tell thousands of stories.

The problem is telling a good story. When you want to become a specialist in the art of storytelling, or even make it your profession, you face immense difficulties. First, you must acquire a deep and precise understanding of a subject as vast and complex as possible. Then you must be able to apply this understanding to fiction. For most authors, this is the greatest challenge of all.

I want to be very precise about the various obstacles inherent in narrative techniques; it's the only way to overcome them. The first of these obstacles is the common terminology with which most authors think about their stories. Terms like "dramatic progression," "climax," and "denouement," which date back to Aristotle, are so broad and theoretical that they are almost meaningless. Let's be honest: they have no practical value for an author. Imagine you're writing a scene where your hero is hanging in the void, on the brink of dying from a fall. Is this a stage of the dramatic progression, the denouement, or the opening scene of the story? It could be any of these things, or all at once, but in any case, these terms don't tell you how to write the scene, or whether you should write it at all.

Classical narrative terminology is an even greater obstacle to acquiring good technique: its very conception of what a story is and how it works. As an apprentice author, the first thing you probably did was read Aristotle's Poetics. Aristotle is, in my opinion, the greatest philosopher in history. But his vision of storytelling, though powerful, is strangely narrow, focused on a limited number of plots and genres. It is also extremely theoretical and difficult to put into practice. That's why most authors seeking practical advice from Aristotle leave empty-handed.

If you're a screenwriter, you probably moved from Aristotle to a simpler vision of the story called the "three-act model." But this idea also poses problems because the three-act model, although much easier to understand than Aristotle, is extremely reductive and, in many ways, completely wrong.

This theory claims that every screenplay consists of three "acts": the first corresponds to the beginning, the second to the middle, and the third to the end. The first act is about thirty pages long. The third act is also about thirty pages. And the second act consists of about sixty pages. The three-act story is supposed to have two or three "high points" (of any kind). Got it? Good. Now try writing a screenplay with that.

We simplify this narrative theory, but in reality, not by much. It's obvious that such a reductive approach has even less practical value than Aristotle's. But there's worse: this theory tends to forge a mechanical vision of the story. The division into acts comes from the conventions of traditional theater, where the curtain is closed to signal the end of an act. This division into acts has no place in films, novels, short stories, or even, it seems to us, in many contemporary plays.

In short, the division into acts is external to the story. The three-act structure is a mechanical element imposed on the story, which has nothing to do with its internal logic—where the story should or should not go.

A mechanical vision of the story, like the three-act theory, inevitably leads to episodic storytelling. An episodic narrative consists of an accumulation of parts, like objects stored in boxes. The events of the story are discontinuous elements that are not firmly connected to build the narrative progressively, from beginning to end. The result is a story that moves the audience only sporadically, or not at all.

There is another obstacle to mastering storytelling, which is related to the writing process. Since many authors have a mechanical vision of what fiction is, they rely on a mechanical process to write. This is especially true for screenwriters, whom a mistaken idea of what makes a script marketable leads to writing scripts that are neither popular nor good. These screenwriters generally base their work on an idea that is just a slight variation of the story of a film they saw six months ago. They apply a genre to this idea, such as "crime," "romance," or "action," and fill in the boxes of characters and plot twists according to the codes of that genre. The result: the story is extremely generic, mechanical, devoid of originality.

In this book, I want to present things differently. My goal is to explain how a good story works and to outline the techniques necessary for its creation so that you can have every chance of writing one yourself. Some will say that it's impossible to teach the art of storytelling. I don't share this view, but I believe that to succeed, one must think about the story and define it in a new way.

In short, I will outline a practical poetics that will work equally well for writing a screenplay, a novel, a play, a serial, or a short story. I will:

• Show that a good story is an organic story—not a machine, but a body that evolves.

• Treat storytelling as a craft based on precise techniques that will help you succeed, regardless of the medium or genre you choose.

• Work on a writing process that will also be organic, meaning we will develop characters and a plot that will naturally evolve from your original idea.

The main challenge an author faces is overcoming the contradiction between the first and third of these tasks. You build your story from hundreds, even thousands of elements using a wide range of techniques. But despite this, the story must seem organic to the audience, who must perceive it as an individual thing that develops and builds towards a climax. If you want to master the art of storytelling, you must master this technique thoroughly, to the point where your characters seem to act on their own, doing what they have to do, while you pull the strings.

In this sense, we authors are very close to athletes. When you watch a great athlete, everything seems easy, as if their body naturally moves that way. But the reality is that they have mastered the techniques of their sport so well that this technical aspect has become invisible to the audience, who sees only the beauty.

THE STORYTELLER AND THE AUDIENCE

Let's start simply, with a very short definition of the story:

A storyteller tells an audience what someone did to get what they wanted and why they did it.

You'll notice that there are three distinct elements: the storyteller, the audience, and the story being told.

A storyteller is above all someone who plays. Stories are verbal games that the author plays with their audience (who doesn't keep score—that's the job of studios, TV channels, or publishing houses). The storyteller imagines the characters and actions. They tell what happens, presenting a series of actions that have been accomplished in a certain way. And even if they tell the story in the present (as in theater or cinema), the author summarizes all the events so that the audience feels it is a complete story, a unit.

But telling a story is not just inventing events or remembering past events. Events are just description. The storyteller must select, connect, and build a series of intense moments. These moments will be so exciting that the audience will feel like they are experiencing them themselves. Telling a story well is not just telling the audience what happened in a life. It's giving them the experience of that life. It's the essence of life, but conveyed in such a fresh and new way that the audience feels it is part of the essence of their own life.

Well-told stories allow the audience to relive events in the present, and thus understand the forces, choices, and emotions that drove the character to act as they did. Stories allow the audience to acquire a certain form of knowledge—emotional knowledge—what was once called wisdom, but they do so in an entertaining and diverting way.

As a creator of verbal games that allow the audience to relive a life, the author constructs a kind of human puzzle and asks the audience to try to understand it. The author creates this puzzle in two main ways: they give the audience certain information about their characters and hide certain information. These hidden pieces of information are absolutely necessary for the story to work. They tend to push the reader or viewer to try to understand who the character is and what they are doing. Consequently, they help them enter the story. When the audience no longer needs to try to understand the story, they cease to be an audience, and the story stops.

The audience loves both the emotional part (reliving a life) and the intellectual part (trying to understand the puzzle). Every good story must be composed of these two parts. But there is a whole range of forms of fiction, stretching from one extreme to the other, from sentimental melodrama to the most cerebral detective stories.

THE STORY

There are thousands, even millions of stories. But what makes each of them a story? What are the common points between all stories? What does the storyteller always reveal and hide from their audience?

KEY POINT: Every story is a form of communication that expresses the dramatic code.

The dramatic code, deeply rooted in the human mind, is an artistic description of the possibilities of a person's development. This code is also a process that underlies every story. The storyteller hides this process under particular actions and characters. But it is this code of development that the audience will ultimately retain from a good story.

Let's start by studying the dramatic code in its simplest form.

According to the dramatic code, transformation is fueled by desire. The "universe of the story" cannot be defined by the formula "I think, therefore I am" but rather by "I want, therefore I am." It is desire, in all its facets, that makes the world go round. It is what moves every conscious living being and gives them direction. Telling a story is exposing what a person wants, what they do to get it, and the price they have to pay to achieve their ends.

When the character is driven by desire, the story "walks" on two "legs": action and discovery. A character seeking to fulfill a desire undertakes actions to get what they want and learns how to best achieve it. When they learn new information, they make a decision and change their way of acting.

All stories follow this movement. But some forms of stories emphasize one aspect more than the other. The genre that relies most on action is the myth, as well as its modern version, the action story. The genres that rely most on discovery are detective stories and multiple viewpoint dramas.

A character seeking to fulfill a desire and encountering obstacles is forced to make efforts (otherwise, there is no story). And these efforts make them evolve. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the dramatic code, and of the author, is to present the transformation that has occurred within a character or to explain why this transformation did not occur.

The different forms of storytelling all have a specific way of expressing the transformation a human being undergoes:

• The myth presents the longest of all developments, from birth to death and from animal to divine.

• Plays generally focus on the moment when the main character makes a crucial decision.

• Films (especially in American cinema) present the minimal change a character must undergo while pursuing a limited goal with great intensity.

• Classic short stories generally trace the few events that led a character to have an insight.

• Serious novels generally deal with how a person interacts and evolves within a society, or accurately depict the mental and emotional process that leads to their transformation.

• TV series present a number of characters who, in a micro-society, strive to change simultaneously.

Drama is a code of maturity. Its central point is the moment of transformation, the impact, the moment when the person frees themselves from their habits, weaknesses, and ghosts of the past to transform into a more fulfilled and accomplished being. The dramatic code reflects the idea that human beings can become an improved version of themselves, psychologically and morally. And that's why people love it so much.

KEY POINT: A story does not present the audience with the "real world"; it presents them with the universe of the story. The universe of the story is not a reproduction of life as it really exists. It is life as human beings imagine it could be. It is a condensed and exaggerated human life so that the audience can gain a better understanding of how real life works.

THE BODY OF THE STORY

A good story describes an organic process that human beings go through. But it is also a living body in itself. The simplest children's story consists of many parts, or subsystems connected to each other and dependent on each other. Just as the human body consists of a nervous system, a circulatory system, a skeleton, etc., a story consists of different subsystems: characters, plot, sequence of twists, universe of the story, moral debate, network of symbols, weaving of scenes, and symphonic dialogues (all these points will be developed in the following chapters).

One could say that the theme, or what I call the moral debate, is the brain of the story. The main character is its heart and circulatory system. The twists are its nervous system. The structure of the story is its skeleton. The weaving of scenes, its skin.

KEY POINT: Each subsystem of the story consists of a network of elements that contribute to defining and differentiating the other elements.

No element of your story, including the hero, can function if you do not first create and define it in relation to all the other elements.

MOVEMENT OF THE STORY

To understand the movement of an organic story, one can refer to nature. Just like the storyteller, nature often connects different elements in sequences. The diagram below represents a number of distinct elements that must necessarily be connected to each other over time:

Nature uses a few basic patterns (as well as a number of variations) to connect elements in sequences, sequences that can be linear, zigzag, spiral, branching, or explosive. Storytellers use one of these patterns, or a combination of them, to connect the different elements of the narrative over time. The linear and explosive patterns are the two opposite extremes. With the linear pattern, things happen one after the other, as if they were following a straight line. With the explosive pattern, everything happens at once. The zigzag, spiral, and branching patterns are combinations of the linear and explosive patterns. Here's how these narrative patterns work.

The Linear Narrative

The linear pattern follows the evolution of a single character, from beginning to end, like this:

A historical or biological explanation of what happened is then necessary. Most American films are linear. They focus on a single hero, who seeks to fulfill a single desire, with great intensity. The audience watches how they try to achieve their goal and how they are transformed by it.

The Zigzag Narrative

The zigzag story has a winding path, seemingly without a particular direction. In nature, the zigzag is the shape of rivers, snakes, and the brain:

Myths like The Odyssey; comedic travel stories like Don Quixote; The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling; Adventures of Huckleberry Finn; Little Big Man and Flirting with Disaster; as well as many of Dickens' stories, such as David Copperfield, take the form of a zigzag. The hero has a desire, but this desire is not intense. They move across a wide territory randomly; and they encounter many characters from different strata of society.

The Spiral Narrative

A spiral is a path that coils around itself, heading towards a center:

In nature, the spiral is the shape of cyclones, horns, and shells.

Thrillers, such as Vertigo, Blow-Up, The Conversation, and Memento, often take the form of a spiral, where a character keeps returning to a single event or memory, and thus gradually explores it.

The Branching Narrative

Branching is a system of paths that extend from a few central points, dividing into increasingly smaller parts, as shown below:

In nature, branching is characteristic of trees, leaves, and waterways.

In a narrative, each branch generally represents in detail an entire society or a part of a society that the hero explores. Branching is found in highly developed fictions such as Gulliver's Travels and It's a Wonderful Life, or in stories with multiple heroes, like Nashville, American Graffiti, or Traffic.

The Explosive Narrative

An explosion presents multiple paths that extend simultaneously; in nature, the explosive pattern is found in volcanoes or dandelions.

As for scenarios, you can't show the audience several elements at once, even in a single scene, because you have to say things one after the other; thus, there are no truly explosive narratives. However, you can give the appearance of simultaneity. In cinema, this appearance is given through the technique of cross-cutting.

Narratives that (apparently) show simultaneous actions involve a comparative explanation of events. By seeing several elements at once, the audience grasps the key idea inherent in each element. Narratives of this type also focus on exploring the universe of the story, exposing the connections between the various elements of this world and showing how each character adapts, or does not adapt, to the whole.

Narratives that emphasize simultaneous actions generally use a branching structure. These include American Graffiti; Pulp Fiction; Traffic; Syriana; Crash; Nashville; Tristram Shandy; Ulysses by Joyce; Last Year at Marienbad; Ragtime; The Canterbury Tales; L.A. Confidential and Hannah and Her Sisters. Each of these stories represents a different combination of linear and simultaneous narrative, but each emphasizes characters coexisting in the universe of the story, as opposed to a single protagonist evolving from a starting point to an endpoint.

WRITING YOUR OWN STORY

Now let's move on to practice: what writing process will give you the best chance of creating a good story?

Most authors don't use the best process. They use the easiest one. A process that could be described in four words: external, mechanical, fragmentary, generic. There are, of course, many variations of this process, but they all work more or less the same way.

The author starts with a premise, a story idea that is a vague copy of an existing story. Or a combination of two stories they have creatively spliced together (or so they think). Aware of the importance of a strong main character, our author focuses almost all their attention on their hero. They "inflate" this character mechanically, piling on as many distinctive traits as they can, and they plan to make their hero change in the last scene. They design the adversaries and secondary characters separately from the hero and see them as less important. Consequently, these characters are almost always weak and underdeveloped.

As for the theme, our author almost completely avoids it, so that no one can accuse them of "trying to convey a message." Or they express it exclusively in dialogue. They set the story in a world that seems suited to their character, most often a big city, since most readers or viewers live in a big city. They don't try to use symbols; that would be too obvious and too pretentious.
He imagines a plot and a series of scenes based on a single question: and then, what happens next? He often sends his hero to various locations. He organizes his plot relying on the three-act structure that divides the story into three parts but does not connect the events beneath the surface. Consequently, the plot is episodic, with each event (or scene) appearing isolated. He complains of having "second act problems" and cannot understand why the story does not lead to a "punchy" climax that deeply affects the audience. Finally, he writes dialogues whose sole function is to advance the plot, with all the conflict concentrated on the present action. If he is ambitious, he ensures that the theme is expressed by the hero through dialogue, towards the end of the story.

While most authors use an approach that is external, mechanical, fragmented, and generic, the writing process we will work on can be described as internal, organic, interconnected, and original. We must warn you right now: this process is not easy. But I believe that this approach or its variants are the only ones that truly work. The other advantage is that they can be taught. Here is the writing process we will present in this book: we will study storytelling techniques in the order in which you will use them to build your narrative. More importantly: you will build your story from the inside out. This implies two things: (1) making your story personal and unique and (2) finding and developing what is original in your story idea. As the chapters progress, your narrative will develop and become more detailed, and each part will remain connected to all the others.

• The Premise We will start with the premise, that is, your entire narrative condensed into a single sentence. This premise will highlight the essence of your story, which will tell us how to develop your idea to get the most out of it.

• The Seven Key Steps of Narrative Structure The seven key steps of story structure are the major stages of your story's development and the hidden dramatic code beneath the surface. These seven structural steps should be conceived as the DNA of your narrative. By working on these seven key steps, you will give your story stable and solid foundations.

• Characters We will then create the characters, not from scratch, but by gradually defining them from your original story idea. We will connect and compare each character to all the others, so that they are all strong and well-defined. Then we will determine the function each of them must fulfill to help your hero develop.

• The Theme (or Moral Debate) The theme is your moral viewpoint, the way you think people should act in the world. But rather than making characters the spokespersons of a message, we will express a theme inherent to your story idea. And we will express this theme through the story's structure so that it surprises the audience and touches them at the same time.

• The Story Universe We will then create the story universe by designing it as an extension of your hero. The story universe will help you define your hero and present the audience with a physical expression of their development.

• The Network of Symbols Symbols are small packets of highly condensed meaning. We will define a network of symbols that will highlight different aspects of the characters, the story universe, and the plot.

• The Plot It is from the characters that we will discover the form the narrative should take; the plot will develop from your characters. By using the twenty-two steps of narrative structure (the seven key steps and fifteen others), we will define a plan in which all elements are connected beneath the surface and lead to a surprising but logically necessary conclusion.

• Weaving Scenes In the final step before writing the scenes, we will establish the list of all the story's scenes, with all plots and themes intertwining to form a tapestry.

• Constructing Scenes and Symphonic Dialogues Finally, we will write the story by constructing each scene so that it allows your hero's development. We will write dialogues whose function is not just to advance the plot—dialogues with a symphonic quality—by playing several "instruments" and levels at the same time.

I can promise you one thing: you will take great pleasure in this creative process as you watch your story develop before your eyes. Let's begin without delay.

QUESTIONS / ANSWERS

Some authors react negatively to the idea of structure because they think structure tends to restrict creativity and art. They believe one can very well write a first draft by immersing oneself in the scenario and creating the story as it unfolds. You advise planning the story and its entire structure before starting the first draft. If the result is comparable, what is the difference?

A: The idea that structure would harm creativity stems from the old romantic notion that art comes from divine intervention. And it is dangerously wrong. The reality is that art comes from technique. And the most important element of technique is structure.

The results of the two approaches are not comparable. With the first approach, you hit a wall after twenty to thirty pages. It is almost inevitable, and it is one of the hallmarks of amateurism.

Paradoxically, starting by structuring your story is far more creative than inventing as you go because it provides solid foundations on which you can rely to take creative risks. You know that the structure is there to tell you whether the creative leap you want to make will work or not. If you have started by determining the right general narrative structure for your story, each scene you write will move you forward on the right path for your hero.

The second approach also allows you to save a tremendous amount of time and effort in the writing process. For every hour you spend on preliminary structuring—your preliminary work on the story—you will save ten on the time you will then spend writing and rewriting. Do not make the mistake that too many authors make by thinking, "I'll fix it in the rewrite." They never do.

The Premise

Michael Crichton does not have the deep characters of Chekhov nor the brilliant plots of Dickens. But he happens to be simply the best premise author in Hollywood. Take Jurassic Park, for example. Crichton's script likely started from this founding principle: "What would happen if we took the two greatest heavyweights of evolution—dinosaurs and humans—and forced them to fight to the death in an arena?" That's a script we want to read.

There are many ways to start the writing process. Some authors prefer to begin by dividing the story into its seven main steps, a method we will study in the next chapter. But most of them start with the shortest expression of the story as a whole: the premise.

WHAT IS THE PREMISE?

The premise is the story formulated in a single sentence. It is the simplest link between character and plot, usually consisting of an event triggering the action, an indication of the main character, and an indication of the story's outcome.

Here are some examples:

• The Godfather: The youngest son of a mafia family avenges the men who shot his father and becomes the new Godfather.

• Moonstruck: While her fiancé visits his mother in Italy, a woman falls in love with her future brother-in-law.

• Casablanca: A hardened American expatriate reunites with a former love, whom he eventually abandons to fight the Nazis.

• A Streetcar Named Desire: An aging beauty tries to get a man to marry her while enduring constant attacks from her sister's violent husband.

• Star Wars: As a princess is in mortal danger, a young man uses his fighting skills to save her and defeat the evil forces of a galactic empire.

For all sorts of practical reasons, a good premise is absolutely necessary for the success of your endeavor. First, Hollywood aims to sell films worldwide and capture a large portion of revenue on their opening weekend. That's why producers look for high-concept premises—films that can be reduced to a catchy descriptive sentence that audiences will instantly understand and that will drive them to the cinema.

Moreover, your premise is your inspiration. It's the light bulb moment when you think, "This would make a great script." And this enthusiasm gives you the perseverance needed to spend months, even years, laboriously writing.

Which brings us to another important point: for better or worse, the premise is also your prison. Once you decide to develop an idea, you must realize that there are hundreds of other potential ideas you won't write about. It is therefore important that you are satisfied with the particular universe you have chosen.

KEY POINT: What you have chosen to write is far more important than any decision you will make about how you will write it.

The last reason why it is necessary to have a good premise is that it will be the decision on which all other decisions you make during the writing process will be based. Characters, plot, theme, symbols—all of this stems from your story idea. If you fail at the premise stage, you won't be able to recover. When the foundations are faulty, no work on the upper floors can make the building stable. You may be excellent with characters, a master of plot, or a genius of dialogue, but if your premise is weak, nothing can save your story.

KEY POINT: Nine out of ten screenwriters fail at the premise stage.

If so many screenwriters fail at this stage, it's because they don't know how to develop their idea, how to unearth the treasure buried within it. They don't grasp that the greatest advantage of the premise is that it allows you to explore the entire story, as well as the many forms it can take before writing it.

The premise offers a good illustration of the dangers of ignorance. Most screenwriters know the importance Hollywood places on high-concept premises. What they don't know is that the marketing argument will never tell them what the organic story requires.

They also ignore the structural weakness inherent in any high-concept premise: these premises provide only two or three scenes, those just before and just after the twist that makes them unique. An average feature film has forty to seventy scenes. A novel can have double or even triple that. It is only by mastering the art of storytelling in its entirety that one can overcome the limits of high concept and successfully tell the whole story.

The first technique to unearth the treasure of an idea is to take your time. The beginning of the writing process indeed requires a lot of time. And we're not talking about hours, or even days. We're talking about weeks. Don't make the amateur mistake of starting with a nice premise and immediately writing scenes. You'll write twenty to thirty pages and find yourself in a dead end from which you cannot escape.

In the writing process, the premise stage is where you explore the overall strategy of your fiction—where you determine the whole and define the general shape and evolution of the story. You start from almost nothing to be able to continue. That's why the premise stage is the most experimental of the writing process. You fumble in the dark, exploring various possibilities to determine what works and what doesn't, what forms an organic whole and what doesn't fit in.

This means you must remain flexible, open to all possibilities. That's why it's so important to use a creative and organic method as a guide.

DEVELOPING YOUR PREMISE

During the weeks you try to define your premise, use these steps that will allow you to turn your starting sentence into a good story.

Step 1: Write Something That Could Change Your Life

The bar is set very high, but this is probably the best advice you will receive in your writing career. We have never seen anyone fail by following it. Why? Because if a story is so important to you, it is likely to be important to many readers or viewers as well. And when you finish writing this story, whatever happens, you will have changed your life.

You may be thinking, "I'd love to write a story that would change my life, but how can I know it will before I've written it?" It's very simple. Do something that most authors, quite strangely, never do: a little introspection. Most authors simply imagine a premise that is just a vague copy of someone else's film, book, or play. This premise seems to have commercial appeal, but it is in no way personal. The story that will result will never go beyond the general stage and will thus be doomed to failure.

To do introspection, to have a chance to write something that could change your life, you must collect information about who you are. And you must get this information out of you, place it in front of you, so you can study it with some distance.

Two exercises can help you. First, write a wish list, a list of everything you would like to see in the cinema or theater, or everything you would like to read in a book. It should be everything you find exciting and everything you find entertaining. You can note information about characters you have imagined, write down cool twists, or good lines that have crossed your mind. You can also list themes that matter to you or genres that have always attracted you.

Write all this on as many sheets of paper as necessary. You hold in your hands your personal wish list, so don't reject anything. Eliminate any thought like, "That would cost too much money." And don't try to organize your thoughts. Let one idea lead to another.

The second exercise is to write a list of premises. That is, a list of all the premises you have ever thought of. There may be five, twenty, fifty, or more. Again, use as many sheets of paper as necessary. The key instruction for this exercise is to express each premise in a single sentence. This will force you to be very clear about each idea. And it will allow you to see all your premises on one and the same medium.

Once your wish list and your list of premises are complete, lay them out in front of you and study them. Look for central elements that overlap. You may find certain characters or types of characters appearing multiple times, notice a particular tone recurring in your different lines, note that one or two types of stories (or genres) repeat, or that you often return to a particular theme, subject, or time period.

As you study your lists, the contours of what you like will begin to take shape. This will be, in its rawest form, your vision of things. You will have in front of you, on a piece of paper, what you really are, as an author and as a human being. Feel free to return to it as often as necessary.

Note that these two exercises are designed to open you up to the outside and to integrate what is already deep within you. They do not guarantee that you will ever write a story that will change your life. Nothing could guarantee that. But it is very likely that once this essential introspection exercise is completed, all the premises that come to mind will be more personal and original.

Step 2: Determine What Is Possible

If many authors fail at the premise stage, it is often because they do not know how to grasp the true potential of their story. This task requires both experience and technique. What you need to determine here is the direction your idea can take, how it can flourish. Do not limit yourself to a single possibility, even if it seems very good to you.

KEY POINT: Explore all the possibilities available to you. This will allow you to reflect on the many directions your idea can take and choose the best one.

To explore these possibilities, the first technique is to determine if something is promised by the initial idea. Some ideas indeed generate certain expectations, things that should happen to satisfy the audience if it turns out that this idea becomes a story. These "promises" can lead you to the best possibilities for developing your idea.

But there is another, more useful technique for determining what is possible from the initial idea: asking yourself, "What would happen if...?" This form of question leads to two distinct points: your story idea and your own mind. It helps you define what is allowed by the story universe and what is not. It also allows you to explore how your mind moves in this imaginary world. The more you ask yourself "What would happen if...?", the more you immerse yourself in this world, the more you flesh it out and provide it with details, and the more you make it convincing to the audience.

The important thing here is to let your mind run free. Do not censor yourself; do not judge yourself. Never tell yourself that one of the ideas that came to mind is stupid. "Stupid" ideas often lead to creative inventions.

To better understand this process, we will examine stories that have already been written and imagine what their authors might have thought as they explored the various possibilities of their premises.

WITNESS

(Earl W. Wallace and William Kelley, based on an original story by William Kelley, 1985)

A little boy witnessing a crime is a classic basis for a thriller. It promises exciting perils, intense action, and violence. But what if we pushed the story further to explore violence in America? What if we showed the two extremes of the use of force—violence and pacifism—by having the little boy move from the peaceful world of the Amish to the violence of the city? What if we then forced a man of violence, the hero cop, to enter the Amish world and fall in love? And then, what if we brought violence to the heart of pacifism?

TOOTSIE

(Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal, based on an original story by Don McGuire and Larry Gelbart, 1982)

The idea that immediately comes to the audience's mind is to be entertained by watching a man dressed as a woman. And you suspect they will want to see the character in as many comical situations as possible. But what if we tried to go beyond these useful but too obvious expectations? What if we exploited the hero's strategy to show how men experience love deep down? What if we made the hero a macho who is forced to take on the disguise—the one of a woman—that he least wants to wear but most needs to evolve? What if we intensified the pace and plot to tip the story towards farce by showing several men and women chasing each other?

CHINATOWN

(Robert Towne, 1974)

A man investigating a murder in 1930s Los Angeles promises all sorts of twists and surprises typical of a good detective story. But what if the crime took on increasingly significant dimensions? What if the detective started by investigating the smallest "crime" there is, adultery, and ended up discovering that the whole city was built on a murder? We could then reveal more and more to the audience, until we unveil the darkest secrets of American life.

THE GODFATHER

(Novel by Mario Puzo, screenplay by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, 1972)

With a story about a mafia family, you promise ruthless killers and violent crimes. But what if we made the family head larger, if we made him the king of kings in America? What if the head of the dark side of America, as powerful in the criminal world as the president, found himself in official America? This man being a king, we could create a great tragedy, a Shakespearean rise and fall, the death of a king and his replacement by another. What if we turned a simple crime story into a dark American epic?

MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS

(Novel by Agatha Christie, screenplay by Paul Dehn, 1974)

A man killed in a train compartment right next to the one where a brilliant detective is sleeping promises an ingenious detective story. But what if we wanted to take the idea of justice beyond the classic arrest of the murderer? What if we sought to show the ultimate expression of poetic justice? What if the victim deserved to die and a natural jury of twelve men and women had been both his judge and executioner?

BIG

(Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg, 1988)
The story of a little boy who wakes up to find he has become an adult promises an entertaining fantasy comedy. But what if this comedy were set not in a distant, strange world, but in one any child could recognize? What if the hero were sent into a real child's dream, a toy factory, and allowed to leave with a pretty, sexy woman? And what if the story wasn't just about a child growing up physically, but also presented the ideal combination of man and little boy necessary for everyone to live a happy adult life?

Step 3: Identify the challenges and problems raised by the story

There are construction rules that apply to all stories. But each story also has its own set of specific rules or challenges. These are particular problems deeply rooted in the basic idea. You can't dodge them. And you shouldn't dodge them. These problems are landmarks that will help you discover your true story. You must tackle these problems head-on and solve them if you want to develop your story well. Most authors don't identify these problems, or they do so once the story is finished. That's far too late.

The trick is to learn to identify these problems at the premise stage. Of course, even the best authors can't identify all the problems at this stage of the process. But once you master the key techniques of characters, plot, theme, story universe, symbols, and dialogue, you'll be surprised at how easily you can pinpoint the inherent difficulties in any idea. Here are just a few of the challenges and problems raised by the following story ideas:

STAR WARS

(George Lucas, 1977)

In any epic, but especially in one set in space like Star Wars, you must quickly introduce a wide range of characters and then let them interact over a long period and in a vast space. You must make the futuristic story credible and understandable in the present. And you must find a way to create a transformation in a hero who is morally good from the start of the story.

FORREST GUMP

(Novel by Winston Groom, screenplay by Eric Roth, 1994)

How to turn forty years of historical events into a personal, coherent, and organic story? Here are some of the problems raised: creating a mentally delayed hero capable of leading the plot, having deep opinions, and experiencing a transformation, while finding a good balance between fantasy and genuine feelings.

BELOVED

(Toni Morrison, 1987)

The main challenge Toni Morrison faced was writing a story about slavery in which the heroine was not depicted as a victim. Such an ambitious story generates a number of problems that must be resolved: maintaining a coherent narrative line despite constant jumps between past and present, ensuring that events from a distant past speak to today's audience, advancing the plot despite characters who react more than they act, showing the psychic impact slavery had on those who lived through it, and demonstrating how its effects continue to be felt years after its abolition.

JAWS

(Novel by Peter Benchley, screenplay by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb, 1975)

Writing a "realistic" horror story—in which characters fight against one of man's natural predators—raises many problems: designing a fair confrontation against an adversary with limited intelligence, creating a situation where the shark can attack often, and writing an ending that matches a duel between the hero and the shark.

THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN

(Mark Twain, 1885)

The main challenge the author of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn faced was enormous: how to present the moral—or more precisely immoral—structure of an entire nation in fictional terms? This brilliant story idea carries some major problems: using a little boy to lead the action; maintaining a brisk pace despite an episodic structure; and credibly presenting the acquisition of a great moral sense by a simple, not entirely admirable little boy.

THE GREAT GATSBY

(F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925)

Fitzgerald's challenge was to present the corrupted American dream reduced to a competition for glory and money. His problems were equally imposing: creating narrative dynamism while the hero only helps someone else, engaging the audience with superficial characters, and turning a small love story into a metaphor for America.

DEATH OF A SALESMAN

(Arthur Miller, 1949)

Arthur Miller's main challenge was to turn the life of a little man into a great tragedy. The problems to solve were: mixing past and present events without confusing the audience, maintaining narrative dynamism, and putting some hope in a desperate and violent conclusion.

Step 4: Find a guiding principle

Once the promises and inherent problems of your story are defined, you must find a global strategy that will determine how you write your story. The guiding principle of your story is your global strategy formulated in a single sentence. This guiding principle will help you develop the premise into a solid structure.

KEY POINT: The guiding principle is what organizes the story as a whole. It is the internal logic of the narrative, which intrinsically cements the different parts so that the story is much more than the sum of its parts. It is what makes the story original.

In short, the guiding principle is the source of your story. And if you want to make your story original and effective, it is the most important factor to consider. This guiding principle can be a symbol or a metaphor (called "central symbol," "great metaphor," or "extended metaphor"). But it is often something broader than that. The guiding principle follows the fundamental process that will unfold throughout the story.

Guiding principles are difficult to pinpoint. And it must be said that most stories don't have one. Because they are standard stories told in a generic way. This is the difference between the premise, which is found in all stories, and the guiding principle—which is only found in good stories. The premise is concrete; it tells the facts. The guiding principle is abstract; it is a deeper process that develops within a story told in an original way. Formulated in one line:

Guiding principle = story process + original development

Imagine you are an author seeking to present the inner workings of the Mafia in America, as hundreds of screenwriters and novelists have done before you. If you are really good, you end up finding this guiding principle (for The Godfather):

Using the classic fairy tale strategy of explaining how the youngest of three brothers becomes the new "king."

It is important to understand the guiding principle as the "synthetic idea," the "constructive cause" of the narrative; it is the guiding principle that, internally, makes the story an individual unit and makes it different from all other stories.

KEY POINT: Find your guiding principle and stick to it. Take the time to find one and keep it in mind throughout the writing process.

Let's take the example of Tootsie to study how the difference between the premise and the guiding principle can manifest in a real script.

• Premise An actor who can't find work disguises himself as a woman and lands a role in a TV series, before falling in love with one of the actresses on the team.

• Guiding principle Forcing a macho man to live in a woman's skin.

How to determine the guiding principle from the premise? Don't make the mistake most authors make at this stage. Instead of looking for a unique guiding principle, they choose a genre, impose it on their premise, and then try to force the story to respect the highlights (the events) of that genre. The result? A mechanical, generic, and unoriginal fiction.

To find your guiding principle, you will need to study the simple and short premise sentence you have before you. You must, like an investigator, "detect" the shape of your story from its premise.

This does not mean that there is only one unique guiding principle per idea, that everything is already fixed or predetermined. From your premise, you can glean all sorts of guiding principles or forms from which you can develop your story. Each will offer you different possibilities to say things; and each will bring you different problems that you will have to solve. Again, there are techniques that can help you.

For example, you can find a guiding principle using the metaphor of the journey or voyage. Huck Finn descending the Mississippi on a raft with Jim, Marlow sailing into the "heart of darkness," Leopold Bloom from Ulysses moving through Dublin, Alice falling down the rabbit hole before entering the topsy-turvy Wonderland—each time using the journey metaphor to organize the organic process of the story.

Notice how the use of the journey in Heart of Darkness provides a guiding principle to a very complete work of fiction:

The journey of a narrator going up a river into the jungle is the line that simultaneously leads him to three different destinations: to the truth about a mysterious, apparently immoral man; to the truth about the narrator himself; and backward to barbarism, to the moral "heart of darkness" that resides in every human being.

A simple symbol can sometimes serve as a guiding principle. This is the case with the red A in The Scarlet Letter, the island in The Tempest, the whale in Moby Dick, or the mountain in The Magic Mountain. You can also connect two great symbols in a single process, such as the green of nature and the black of coal in How Green Was My Valley. Units of time (day, night, four seasons), the narrator's point of view, or any specific way the story evolves can also serve as guiding principles.

Below are some examples of guiding principles drawn from books, films, and plays, from the Bible to "Harry Potter." Observe how they differ from the premise.

MOSES IN THE BOOK OF EXODUS

• Premise When an Egyptian prince discovers he is actually Hebrew, he leads his people out of Egypt and slavery.

• Guiding principle A man who doesn't know who he is struggles to restore his people's freedom and receives new moral laws that will define him and his people.

ULYSSES

• Premise A day in the life of an average man in Dublin.

• Guiding principle A modern odyssey through the city, where in the space of a single day, a man finds a father, who in turn finds a son.

FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL

• Premise A man falls in love with a woman, but she is already engaged, and at their next meeting, he himself is engaged.

• Guiding principle Friends experience four utopias (the weddings) and one nightmarish moment (the funeral), while each of them searches for the ideal partner.

THE "HARRY POTTER" SERIES

• Premise A boy discovers he has magical powers and enrolls in a school for wizards.

• Guiding principle A wizard prince learns to become a man and a king by spending seven school years in a school that trains wizards.

THE STING

• Premise Two small-time con artists swindle the rich man who killed their friend.

• Guiding principle Tell the story of a con in the form of a con and fool both the opponent and the audience.

LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT

• Premise Family members must face the mother's addiction.

• Guiding principle As the day passes and night falls, all family members confront the mistakes and ghosts of their past.

MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS

• Premise A young woman falls in love with the boy next door.

• Guiding principle Depict the evolution of a family over a year through events that occur in each of the seasons.

COPENHAGEN

• Premise Three people recount contradictory versions of a meeting that changed the course of World War II.

• Guiding principle Use Heisenberg's uncertainty principle outside the context of physics to explore the ambiguous morality of the man who discovered it.

A CHRISTMAS CAROL

• Premise Three ghosts visit a miserly old man, who thus regains the Christmas spirit.

• Guiding principle Follow the rebirth of a man by forcing him to observe his past, present, and future on Christmas Eve.

IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE

• Premise As a man is about to commit suicide, an angel shows him what the world would be like if he had never been born.

• Guiding principle Reveal the power of the individual by showing what a town, and a nation, would have been like if a single man had never lived.

CITIZEN KANE

• Premise Tell the life story of a wealthy media magnate.

• Guiding principle Use multiple narrators to demonstrate that one can never truly know a man's life.

Step 5: Determine the best character induced by your idea

Once your guiding principle is determined, it's time to focus on the hero.

KEY POINT: Always tell the story of your best character.

"The best" does not mean "the most likable." It means "the most fascinating, challenging, and complex," even if this character is not particularly likable. If you must tell the story of your best character, it's because that's where your attention, and the audience's, will inevitably go. You will want this character to lead the action.

To determine which is the best character induced by your basic idea, ask yourself this essential question: which one do I adore? You can find the answer to this question by asking yourself a few others: do I want to see him act? Do I like the way he thinks? Do the challenges he faces interest me?

If you don't find any character you adore in your basic idea, move on to another idea. If you find one but it's not the main character, immediately modify your premise so that he takes on that role.

If the basic idea you want to develop seems to induce multiple protagonists, know that you will have as many narrative lines as main characters. You must therefore find the best character for each narrative line.

Step 6: Identify the central conflict

Once you have chosen the character who will lead your story, you must determine what it is essentially about. That is, identify the central conflict of the story. To determine this central conflict, ask yourself the question: "Who fights whom for what?" and answer it in a succinct sentence.

The answer to this question will give you the subject of your story, as all the conflicts in the narrative will essentially stem from this specific problem. The next chapter will develop the subject of conflicts in sometimes complex ways. But it is absolutely necessary that you always keep this formulation of the conflict in a single sentence, as well as that of your guiding principle, in sight.

Step 7: Identify the unique sequence of cause-and-effect relationships

Every good organic story has a single chain of cause and effect: A leads to B, which leads to C, and so on until Z. This is the backbone of your story, and if you don't have a backbone or, conversely, you have too many, your narrative will collapse (we will talk later about stories with multiple heroes).

Let's say you have found the following premise:

A man falls in love and fights his brother for control of a vineyard.

You will notice that it is a divided premise, with two cause-and-effect relationships. However, it is easier to identify the problems of the premise and find solutions when this premise is a unified sentence. When you have written an entire book or script, you feel that the problems of the narrative are set in stone. But when you have only written a single sentence, it is still possible to make a simple modification, which allows, for example, to transform a divided premise into a unified premise, like this:

For the love of a woman, a man fights his brother to take control of a vineyard.

The trick to finding the unique path of cause and effect is to ask: "What is my hero's main action?" Your character will undertake many actions throughout your story. But there must be one action that dominates, that unifies all the other actions he undertakes. The cause-and-effect relationship is nothing other than this action.

To take an example, let's return to the premise of Star Wars:

While a princess is in mortal danger, a young man uses his fighting skills to save her and defeat the evil forces of a galactic empire.

By forcing oneself to describe the film in a single sentence, one comes to understand that the action that unifies all the other actions of Star Wars is "using his fighting skills."

Now let's take the example of The Godfather, an epic book and film. Again, if one follows the process of reducing the story to a single sentence, one can clearly discern the main action:

The youngest of a mafia family takes revenge on the men who shot his father and becomes the new Godfather.

Of all the actions Michael undertakes in the story, the one connected to all the others, the main action, is revenge.

KEY POINT: If you develop a premise with multiple characters, know that each narrative line must have a unique sequence of cause-and-effect relationships. And that all narrative lines must come together to form a broader and more global backbone.

In The Canterbury Tales, for example, each pilgrim tells a story that has an individual backbone. But these stories are told by a group—a microcosm of English society—traveling to Canterbury.

Step 8: Determine the transformation possibilities of your hero

After the guiding principle, the most important thing to find from your premise is the fundamental transformation of your hero. This is the factor that gives the most satisfaction to the audience, whatever form the story may take, even if this transformation is negative (as in The Godfather, for example).

The transformation is what your hero experiences at the end of his confrontation. To simplify to the maximum, this transformation can be represented using a three-part equation:

F X A = T

F represents weaknesses, both psychological and moral; A is the confrontation to accomplish the main action of the story; and T is the transformed person.

In the vast majority of stories, a character with weaknesses struggles to obtain something and emerges from this confrontation transformed (positively or negatively). The basic logic of the narrative is as follows: how does the confrontation to achieve the main action (A) lead the character to change, to move from F to T? You will notice that A, the main action, is the pivot of the equation. If forced to struggle to obtain something, a character with certain weaknesses will necessarily be transformed.

KEY POINT: The main action must be the action most likely to force the character to confront his weaknesses and change.

This is the basis of any story because it is the basis of human evolution. It is difficult to pinpoint how humans evolve, but it is what you, as an author, must express above all else (unless you choose to explain why evolution did not occur).

To achieve this, it is best to start from the main action and then determine the opposites of this action. This is what will allow you to find out who your hero is at the beginning of the story (his weaknesses) and who he is at the end (the transformation he has undergone).

You can follow these steps:

1. Write your premise sentence (know that this premise may be modified once you have discovered your hero's transformation).

2. Determine the main action your hero undertakes throughout the story.

3. Make F (the psychological and moral weaknesses of the hero) and T (his transformation) the opposites of A (the main action).

It is crucial to go to the opposite of the main action; this is the only way a transformation can occur. If your hero's weaknesses are similar to the main action he will undertake during the story, he will only deepen these weaknesses and remain the same.

KEY POINT: Find several possibilities for weaknesses and transformations.

Just as there are several possibilities for developing the premise, there are several possibilities concerning the weaknesses and the transformed person your hero will become. Let's say, for example, that your hero's main action is to become a criminal during the story.

To find possible weaknesses and transformations, you must reflect on this main action and determine its opposites. You will notice that each weakness and each transformation is a possible opposite of the main action.

• A shy and uptight man joins a gang of criminals and ends up divorcing.

F – initial weaknesses: shy and uptight man

A – main action: joins a gang of criminals

T – transformation: ends up divorcing

• A contemptuous and uptight banker joins a gang of criminals and ends up helping the poor.

F – initial weaknesses: contemptuous and uptight banker

A – main action: joins a gang of criminals

T – transformation: ends up helping the poor
• A very shy man joins a gang of criminals and ends up completely drunk.

F – initial weaknesses: very shy man

A – main action: joins a gang of criminals

T – transformation: ends up completely drunk

All these examples show you the possible transformations you can find from the initial premise of a man who becomes a criminal.

Let's put this technique into practice to study two familiar stories.

STAR WARS

• Premise: While a princess is in mortal danger, a young man uses his fighting skills to save her and defeat the evil forces of a galactic empire.

F – initial weaknesses: naive, impetuous, lacks focus and self-confidence

A – main action: uses his fighting skills

T – transformation: self-esteem, gains a place among the happy few, becomes a confirmed fighter

Luke's initial weaknesses do not evoke the qualities of a fighter at all. But pushed to constantly use his warrior skills, he strengthens and becomes a confident fighter for good.

THE GODFATHER

• Premise: The youngest of a mafia family avenges the men who shot his father and becomes the new Godfather.

F – initial weaknesses: cautious, conventional, isolated from the rest of the family

A – main action: revenge

T – transformation: tyrannical, becomes the uncontested leader of the family

The Godfather is a very good example to explain why it is necessary to go to the opposite of the main action to determine the weaknesses and transformation of the hero. If, from the beginning of the story, Michael were presented as a vengeful man, by avenging the men who shot his father, he would remain absolutely the same. His character would not have experienced any transformation. But what if he started the story opposite to revenge? A cautious, conventional man isolated from the rest of his family, who carries out revenge, can end up tyrannical and become the uncontested leader of his family. This is an absolutely radical transformation. But also a totally credible transformation.

Know that the ideas you find using this technique will only correspond to possible transformations for your story. Working on the premise, especially when it comes to characters, is always provisional work. Do not hesitate to think about other transformations as you progress in the writing process. We will explore this determining narrative element in more detail in the next two chapters.

Step 9: Determine the hero's moral choice

The central theme of a story is often crystallized by a moral choice the hero must make, usually towards the end of the story. The theme is your opinion on how to act in the world. It is your point of view on morality, and it is one of the main reasons you write your story.

The best way to express the theme is probably through the structure of the story, through what we call the moral debate. This is where you, the author, defend your vision of life, not with philosophical arguments, but through the actions of characters seeking to achieve a goal (for more details, refer to chapter 5, "The Moral Debate"). The most important step in this debate is undoubtedly the final moral choice you will leave to your hero.

Many authors make the mistake of leaving their hero with a false choice. By false choice, we mean a choice between something positive and something negative. For example, forcing a hero to choose between going to prison and dating the pretty girl. The answer is obvious.

KEY POINT: To make a real choice, your hero must either select one of the two positive possibilities available to him or, but this is rarer, avoid one of the two negative possibilities (as in Sophie's Choice) that present themselves to him.

Make sure to make the two options as equal as possible, one should seem only slightly more attractive than the other. The classic example of choosing between two positive options is the one that opposes love to honor. In A Farewell to Arms, the hero chooses love. In The Maltese Falcon (as in almost all detective stories), the hero chooses honor.

Again, note that this technique will allow you to find possible moral choices. The choice that comes to mind at this stage may very well change completely when you start writing the story. This technique is only meant to force you to start thinking about your theme, in practical terms, from the beginning of the writing process.

Step 10: Think about the audience's reception

Once your work on the premise is done, ask yourself one last question: is this story summarized in one sentence original enough to interest people other than myself?

This is the question of popularity, of commercial appeal. You will need to be inflexible when answering it. If, looking at your premise, you realize that the only people who will be interested in your story are you and your immediate circle, we strongly advise against using it as a base.

You must write first for yourself; write what is close to your heart. But you must not write only for yourself. Authors often make the big mistake of falling into the "either/or" trap: either I write what is close to my heart, or I write something that will sell. This is a false distinction, born from the old romantic idea that one must write in a garret and suffer for one's art.

You may one day come up with an idea that you absolutely must write. You may also have a very good idea and not know if it will interest the public. But never forget that even if you will have many ideas in your life, very few of them can be developed into real stories. You should always try to write something that is close to your heart and that you believe should interest an audience. The things you write must have special meaning for you. But know that when writing for an audience, it is much easier to do what you love.
Q: Can you give some examples from film and television that illustrate the difference between the premise and the guiding principle?

A: These examples illustrate not only the difference between the premise and the guiding principle but also the many ways you can find this guiding principle.

FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL based on the development of the story's universe

• Premise: A man falls in love with a woman, but she is already engaged, and at their next meeting, he himself is engaged.

• Guiding Principle: Friends experience four utopias (the weddings) and one nightmarish moment (the funeral), while each of them searches for the ideal partner.

MENTALIST based on a character contrast

• Premise: A so-called medium uses his observational skills and manipulation talents to solve criminal cases.

• Guiding Principle: Series creator Bruno Heller sums it up as: what if Sherlock Holmes and Angelina Jolie had a son?

In this example, the premise and the guiding principle provide the audience with a strong character contrast that generates a strong contrast in the plot. The hero will use this contrast and the combination of Sherlock Holmes' mind and Angelina Jolie's charm to solve criminal cases.

Result: the guiding principle intrigues. It draws us into the story. We wonder: how will he do it? And it provides the story with strong narrative dynamism not only for the first season but for the entire series.

BREAKING BAD based on a character transformation sequence

• Premise: When a chemistry teacher discovers he has terminal cancer, he starts making and selling methamphetamine to fund his medical care and secure his family's future after his death.

• Guiding Principle: Series creator Vince Gilligan explained the underlying process of his premise by stating that he wanted to take his main character "from Mr. Chips to Scarface." From the kind English schoolteacher to the deadliest and most ruthless crime boss.

Gilligan then expressed this character transformation in structural terms: he wanted to take the character "from protagonist to antagonist."

This was not only an excellent guiding principle but also a revolutionary one. Before Breaking Bad, American one-hour TV series (as opposed to miniseries or TV movies) were designed to last forever. This was never the case, of course, but if they were designed with this in mind, it was so that TV networks could profit as much as possible during their airing period and then have as many episodes as possible to sell in syndication. This is the main reason why no characters in dramatic TV series, especially not the main character, ever have an epiphany. Never. Because once the main character has experienced a profound personality change, the series is over. And the golden goose disappears.

But you will notice with Breaking Bad's guiding principle that the entire series is built on the hero's personality change, which is at the very least negative. This means that the series was not designed to last forever but rather to have a defined duration, which Gilligan estimated to be between five and seven seasons. It lasted five.

While this limited duration was a source of disappointment for many loyal viewers, it was also one of the keys, if not the key, to the series' genius. Since the unique and negative character transformation was included from the start in the series' guiding principle, each episode and each season had to be structured based on this transformation. The plot always stems from the character. It seems to us that there is no greater principle of storytelling than this.

Each episode thus follows Walter White's gradual transition from Mr. Chips to Scarface, from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde. The writers were able to link the episodes so that each season led to a shattering climax.
For the hero, the confrontation is an intense and painful experience. This trial leads him to a significant realization about his true nature. The quality of your story will largely depend on the quality of this realization. To create a good realization, you must first know that this stage, like that of need, has two aspects, one psychological and the other moral.

In a psychological realization, the hero removes the mask behind which he lived and sees himself as he truly is for the first time. This removal of the mask is neither passive nor easy. It is indeed the most active, difficult, and courageous act the hero has accomplished in the story.

Do not have your hero bluntly state what he has learned. That would be moralizing, not subtle enough, and would tend to repel the audience. It is better to suggest the hero's thoughts through the actions he takes that lead him to the realization.

BIG

Josh understands that he must leave his girlfriend, abandon his life in the toy factory, and become a child again if he wants to have a life full of beautiful things and love when he grows up.

CASABLANCA

Rick forgets his cynicism, regains his idealism, and sacrifices his love for Ilsa to become a freedom fighter.

CHINATOWN

Jake's realization is negative. After Evelyn's death, he mutters: "As little as possible." He seems to think that his life is not only useless but also destructive. This character has also hurt someone he loved.

DANCES WITH WOLVES

Dunbar discovers a new reason and way of living thanks to his wife and his beautiful Sioux Lakota family. But ironically, the Lakota way of life is about to disappear, making Dunbar's realization both positive and negative.

If you have given your hero a moral need, his realization must also be moral. The hero not only sees himself in a new light; he reflects on the appropriate way to act towards others. The hero realizes that he was wrong, that he hurt people, and that he must change. He can then prove he has changed by undertaking a moral action.

TOOTSIE

Michael discovers what it truly means to be a man – "When I was a woman, I was a better man with you than I ever was with another woman when I was a man. I just need to learn to stay like that without a dress" – and he apologizes for hurting the woman he loves. You will notice that even if the hero directly states what he has learned, he does so in a clever and funny way, avoiding any form of sermonizing.

THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN

Huck realizes he was wrong to think of Jim as an inferior being and declares he would rather go to hell than tell Jim's master where he is.

From a structural point of view, the stage most closely related to realization is that of need. These two stages define the transformation the hero will undergo (we will study all this in more detail in the next chapter). The need is the beginning of the transformation the character undergoes. The realization is the endpoint of this transformation. The need marks the hero's immaturity at the beginning of the story. It is what he lacks, what hinders him. The realization is the moment when the hero develops, blossoms as a human being (unless this realization is so painful that it ends up destroying him). It is what he has learned, what he has gained, which will allow him to live a better life in the future.

NEW BALANCE

With the new balance, everything returns to normal, and all desire disappears. That being said, there is now a major difference. Following the trial he has undergone, the hero has moved to a higher or lower stage. A fundamental and immutable transformation has occurred within him. If the realization was positive – he understood who he really was and learned to live in harmony with the world – the hero moves to a higher stage. If it was negative – he understood that he had committed a horrible act, an expression of immense inner weakness – or if he is unable to achieve it, the hero is destroyed.

Let's now study some examples of the hero's ascent.

DIE HARD

John fought the criminals, saved his wife, and reaffirmed his love.

PRETTY WOMAN

Vivian left the world of prostitution and now lives with the man she loves (who, of course, happens to be a billionaire).

THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS

Clarice stopped Buffalo Bill, became an excellent FBI agent, and apparently defeated the ghosts of her past.

The following examples, on the contrary, present the fall of a hero:

OEDIPUS REX

Oedipus blinds himself when he learns he has killed his father and slept with his mother.

THE CONVERSATION

The hero discovers he has been involved in a man's murder and ends up in shock, desperately ransacking his apartment to find bugs.

VERTIGO

The hero drags the woman he loves to the top of a tower to make her confess to a murder, then watches in horror as this woman, overwhelmed by guilt, accidentally falls into the void.
As Bourne approaches his enemies at the Blackbriar headquarters in New York—the eye of the vortex—the pace of the attacks against him quickens, until he jumps from a building just as Vosen tries to kill him.

INCEPTION

Cobb and his team face intense attacks from all directions, at every level of the dream, with an increasingly rapid pace as the van nears the water.

Cobb's main adversary is the CEO, whose mind is filled with powerful defenders repelling any invasion, including an express train and an avalanche, with overwhelming force. Other adversaries include the aggressive memory of Cobb's deceased wife and the world of limbo, from which Cobb might never escape.

Q: How do you write a good story about a character whose essential nature is to have no clear desire? Don't you think that most of the time we are tossed around by daily life and that a clear desire doesn't exist? Shouldn't the story also speak to this for the audience to relate?

A: Some authors believe it's unrealistic for a character to have a single, strong desire. Over a lifetime, this is quite true. But stories aren't real life. They represent a particular moment in a character's life where they confront, or are confronted by, an existential problem and either overcome it or fail. In a story, you isolate this segment of the character's life, where their essence is revealed in action.

Viewed this way, the line of desire is merely the medium through which the author structures the story of this confrontation. It doesn't matter if the character has no goal during all other parts of their life.

AMERICAN BEAUTY

At the beginning of American Beauty, Lester, the main character, is the quintessential reactive man. He's pushed around by his wife, daughter, and boss. He admits his position as a loser. He's an idle man in every sense. And the audience feels he has been this aimless man for almost his entire adult life.

But that's not where the story lies. The story isolates the part of Lester's life where he acquires a line of desire, namely the part where he falls head over heels for his daughter's very pretty best friend. It's the pursuit of this passion, this "limit" situation, that allows him to become the best version of himself, even if he dies shortly after.

Q: Why is it so difficult to write a story about a person without a goal?

A: If you still want to write the story of a character without a goal—in other words, a goal-less hero—know that it's always possible. But let's be clear about the structural challenge you'll face: you'll be forcing yourself to write a story without a backbone, a task akin to entering a boxing ring with one hand tied behind your back.

Without a goal, you can't introduce an external adversary eager to prevent the hero from reaching the goal. Without an adversary, you can't create continuous conflict. Without a goal or conflict, you can't create high stakes—why it's important for the hero to win or lose—which means it will be difficult to engage the reader or viewer. And worst of all, your goal-less character will remain without a goal almost until the end of the story, that is, until the moment of realization, where they overcome their greatest flaw.

Q: So, what should I do with the nine-tenths of my story where my hero has no goal?

A: First, ask yourself again if you really want to tell this story. If so, the best technique for telling the story of a goal-less hero is this: postpone the desire.

Initially, your main character is a reactive hero with no desire other than to survive their oppressive environment. As the story progresses, they become an active hero driven by a strong desire.

Q: How do you execute this technique?

A: It's simple.

1. Initially, deprive the hero of strong desire.

This tends to intensify in the audience's eyes the reality of the hero's weakness, need, and problem. Without a goal to set the story on track, you force the audience to emotionally experience the hero's flaws, pain, and horror of the situation.

2. Assign the hero a stronger and more specific line of desire as they gain more power and the story progresses.

A PROPHET

(screenplay by Thomas Bidegain, Jacques Audiard, Abdel Raouf Dafri, and Nicolas Peufaillit, 2009)

Many French films have used this technique, but none better than A Prophet. In the opening scene, 19-year-old Malik enters prison. He has no knowledge of the rules and hierarchy of this extremely dangerous place. His only goal is to survive, and he doesn't even know how to go about it. You'll notice that survival is a very weak and reactive goal. It's the weakest of all narrative goals.

By delaying the introduction of an active and external goal, the screenwriters force the audience, as well as the hero, to dive into the horror of his experience. Malik and the audience feel the terror of deadly dangers that can arise from anywhere, at any time.

After being forced to commit a murder by the "king" of the prisoners, Malik learns to decipher and study the workings of this king's mafia operations. The more he learns about the system's workings, the more his goal becomes active and precise.

He moves from merely wanting to survive day-to-day to wanting to become the head of the criminal empire.

This technique has also been used in a very different genre from the crime film, for The Class, which is a drama based on a true story.

Q: Are there other problems that authors inevitably face when they start creating their story?

A: The second biggest problem is that the main structural steps don't evolve from the first step, which is the hero's weakness and need. The result is that the story violates what we consider the cardinal rule of storytelling: the plot must come from the character.

A plot without character is an abstract puzzle for the audience to solve. A character without plot is a medicine the audience must swallow to learn to become better. None of this produces a satisfying story.

Q: What do you mean by "the plot must come from the character"?

A: Several things. But first and foremost, it means that the plot comes from the hero's weakness and need. In other words, the actions a hero takes on the surface to achieve an external goal ultimately result in a transformation within the hero themselves. If the author doesn't establish this link between character and plot and doesn't present events in the plot that will eventually force the character to change (or fail in their efforts), the story will lack emotion and personal resonance for the audience.

Weakness and need are the source of every story, and their resolution is the raison d'être of every story. In a good narrative, all major structural steps are organically connected to each other, but most importantly, they stem from the hero's original flaw.

Q: How do you ensure that the plot comes from the hero's weakness and need?

A: Through the technique of weakness as the primary cause of the story.

Always make weakness and need the primary cause of your story and ensure it drives the narrative logic from beginning to end. If the line of desire is the track the story follows, as well as its backbone, desire should always serve the step of weakness and need. And the same should apply to all other structural steps of the story.

To tell a good story, the most important criterion of all is the connection of all major structural steps to that of weakness and need (to tell a popular story, the most important criterion of all is narrative dynamism, with a clear line of desire).

Q: How do you implement this technique?

A: You must realize each of these connections in your story:

1. Connect weakness and desire.

Of all the desires you can use in your story, the best is the desire that comes from your hero's major weakness. In other words, in their quest for the goal, the hero is forced to finally confront their flaw, which they either overcome or fail to overcome.

This is first and foremost how the plot (desire) comes from the character (weakness). Your story thus becomes both popular and of quality.

BREAKING BAD

A good TV series uses the seven steps to structure each episode (including the first pilot episode), each season, and the entire series. If Breaking Bad was one of the best dramas in television history, it's mainly because all its major structural steps evolve from the primary cause, the hero's weakness and need, and are connected to it.

Weakness and need: Walter White is a timid man who has never accepted that his former partners arranged for him to lose his shares in a very successful chemistry company. Deep down, he believes he is a genius who has never been recognized for his true worth, and he is determined to stop at nothing to gain that recognition.

Desire: To manufacture and sell methamphetamine to pay for his cancer treatment and secure his family's future after his death.

Using his exceptional gift for chemistry, Walt succeeds so well in manufacturing and selling drugs that he becomes known as Heisenberg and kills anyone who gets in his way.

Like in The Godfather, Walt's desire doesn't push him to overcome his weakness, as he is not a character who evolves. His desire exacerbates his weakness until he dies from his corruption.

2. Connect weakness and adversary.

The adversary, who competes with the hero for the same goal, should be the person most capable of attacking the hero's major weakness. And they should attack this weakness while trying to defeat the hero in the pursuit of this goal.

Every time the adversary attacks, they should hit the hero's flaw, press where it hurts the most, and make the situation terrible for them.

Adversaries: Walt's brother-in-law, Hank Schrader, who is a Drug Enforcement Administration agent; his wife, Skylar, who opposes his desire to sell drugs; several criminals, who compete with Walt in the drug trade; and his associate, Jesse, who is both an ally and an adversary, and who argues with him about how the business should be run.

As a DEA agent tasked with ending methamphetamine trafficking, Hank is trained to track Walt and is led to do so. As Walt's wife, Skylar attacks his most intimate vulnerabilities, including his love for his family and his desire to protect them. Other dealers are much better equipped than the chemistry teacher to win a turf war. Jesse knows Walt's secret and takes advantage of the fact that Walt sees him as a surrogate son.

3. Connect weakness and plan.

The plan is only indirectly connected to the weakness, as it is the strategy the hero will use to defeat the adversary and achieve the goal. But every time their plan fails, the hero must be forced to do some introspection, consider their weaknesses, change, and become stronger.

Plan: Manufacture and sell crystal meth without the police, especially his brother-in-law, and his wife finding out.

Each step Walt takes to build his drug business requires him to lie to his wife and son and kill more or less innocent people. With each setback, he becomes more cunning and ruthless.

4. Connect weakness and confrontation.

The confrontation is not just a violent and intense conflict. It must be the hero's worst nightmare, a nightmare specifically designed for this particular character. Of the entire story, the confrontation must be the most intense test of the hero's flaws and skills.

Confrontation: In the final episode of the series, Walt sets up an ambush to kill all the neo-Nazis who murdered Hank, kidnapped Jesse, and stole his money.

Walt's determination to prove he's a genius and settle all his scores leads him to create an ingenious attack plan, which he has no chance of surviving.

5. Connect weakness and realization.

The realization is the moment when the hero understands how wrong they have been, about themselves and their behavior towards others.

Realization: Like in a classic tragedy, Walt realizes too late. Because of his pride and oversized ego, he is trapped on a train heading straight to hell.

6. Connect weakness and new balance.

Everything then returns to normal. But the hero has either overcome their weakness and evolved or failed to do so and fallen.

New balance: Walt dies, but he has settled all his scores. Jesse escapes.

Walt's pride and genius slowly drew him into a trap of corruption and violence from which he couldn't escape.

Characters

Tootsie was a huge success because the film's main character, played by Dustin Hoffman, was dressed as a woman. True? False. What makes this character funny, and what makes the whole story work, is a network of characters that helps define the hero and allows him to be funny. Look beneath the polished surface of Dustin Hoffman's dress, and you'll see that every character in the story is a particular version of the hero's central moral problem, namely how men mistreat women.

Most authors have a very poor approach to the hero. They start by listing all their distinctive features, tell their story, and then somehow make them change at the end. This technique cannot work.

We will work on a different process, which we believe will be much more useful to you. Here are the different steps:

1. We will start by focusing on the main character, but by observing all the characters together and considering them as different parts of a network of interconnections. We will distinguish each of them by comparing them to others based on their place in the story and their archetype.

2. We will then try to individualize each character by relying on theme and opposition.

3. We will then focus on the hero, "building" them step by step to make them a complex and fleshed-out personality that will appeal to the audience.

4. We will create the adversary in detail, as they are the most important character after the hero and, in many ways, the key to defining the hero.

5. Finally, we will study the different character-related techniques that allow for building conflict throughout the story.

THE CHARACTER NETWORK

The biggest mistake authors make when creating their characters is thinking of the hero and all other characters as distinct individuals. The hero is alone, in their bubble, with no connection to others. The result: not only is the hero weak, but the adversary is a giant with feet of clay, and the secondary characters are even weaker.

This gross mistake is exacerbated in scripts that emphasize the high concept premise. In these stories, the hero seems to be the only person that matters. But ironically, this extreme emphasis on the hero, rather than defining them more clearly, tends to make them appear as a bland marketing tool.

To create good characters, they must be conceived as different parts of a network where each helps define the other. In other words, a character is often defined by what they are not.

KEY POINT: When creating a hero or any character, the most important step is to compare and connect them to all others.

Every time you compare a character to your hero, you force yourself to distinguish your hero in new ways. And you also begin to conceive secondary characters as fully-fledged human beings, as complex and as important as your hero.

All characters connect to each other and define each other based on four points: their role in the story, their archetype, the theme, and the opposition.

Character network based on their functions in the story

Every character must serve the story's purpose, which is defined by the guiding principle (see chapter 2, "The Premise"). Every character has a specific role, a function to fulfill to allow the story to achieve this purpose. Director Peter Brook, speaking about actors, raises an important point for authors seeking to create characters:

[Brecht] insisted that all actors must serve the action of the play. [...] If [each actor] saw themselves in relation to the whole play, they would understand that not only do their overly detailed mannerisms oppose the play's needs, but also that too many undue characteristics could harm them and make their own appearance less remarkable1.

Even if the audience is mostly interested in the nature of the transformation that has occurred within the hero, you can only show them this transformation if each character, including the hero, plays their role in the team. Let's now study the function of the main types of fictional characters.

Hero

The most important character is the main character, or hero. This is the person who has the central problem and leads the action to solve this problem. The hero decides to seek a goal (desire) but possesses certain weaknesses and needs that tend to prevent them from succeeding.

All other characters in the story represent opposition, alliance, or a combination of both, with the hero. Moreover, the story's twists are largely produced by the ebb and flow of opposition and friendship between the various characters and the hero.

• Hero in Hamlet Hamlet

Adversary

The adversary is the character who seeks to prevent the hero from achieving their desire. The adversary must not merely put obstacles in the hero's way. That would be mechanical.

Remember that the adversary must desire the same thing as the hero. This means that the hero and the adversary must come into direct conflict throughout the narrative. This notion of conflict is often missing from stories. That's why it's important to seek the deepest conflict that opposes the hero to their adversary.

The relationship between the hero and the adversary is perhaps the most important of the relationships between characters. Thus, by working on the conflict that opposes them, one also allows the broader themes and stakes of the story to unfold.

Moreover, the adversary is not necessarily a character the hero hates. The hero may love or hate them. The adversary is simply the person who stands opposite. They may be a more sympathetic character than the hero, more moral, and even their friend or lover.

• Main adversary in Hamlet King Claudius

• Second adversary Queen Gertrude

• Third adversary Polonius, the king's advisor

Ally

The ally is there to help the hero. They also serve as a spokesperson, allowing the audience to better understand their values and feelings. Generally, the ally's goal is the same as the hero's, but occasionally the ally has a goal of their own.

• Ally in Hamlet Horatio

False Ally

The false ally is a character who seems to be the hero's friend but is actually an adversary. Creating such a character is one of the best ways to strengthen opposition and plot twists.

The false ally is always one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the story, as they are generally torn by a dilemma. By pretending to be the hero's ally, the false ally ends up feeling close to the hero. And so, while trying to defeat them, they often end up helping them win.

• False allies in Hamlet Ophelia, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern

False Adversary

On the surface, this character fights against the hero, but they are actually an ally. The false adversary is not as common a character as the false ally because they are not as useful to the author. The plot, as we will see in chapter 8, stems from opposition, and particularly from opposition hidden beneath the surface. Allies, including those who initially seem to be adversaries, cannot offer us the same degree of conflict and surprises as an adversary.

• False adversary in Hamlet None

Secondary Character

The secondary character is perhaps one of the most misunderstood characters in fiction. Most authors conceive them as the hero of the subplot—for example, the girlfriend in a detective story. But that is not the role of a true secondary character.

The secondary character has a very specific function in the story, and again the comparative method comes into play. The subplot should be used to compare how the hero and the secondary character face the same problem. It is through contrast that the secondary character highlights the traits and dilemmas of the main character.

Let's take a closer look at Hamlet to better understand how to create a true secondary character. One could say that Hamlet's problem, reduced to a single sentence, is to avenge the man who killed his father. Now, it so happens that Laertes' problem is also to avenge the man who killed his father. The contrast lies in the fact that one murder was premeditated while the other was the result of a mistake and a passionate, impulsive act.

KEY POINT: The secondary character is generally not an ally.
The secondary character, like the ally and the adversary, provides an opportunity to define the hero through comparison and to advance the plot. The ally helps the hero achieve their main goal. The secondary character follows a path parallel to that of the hero and achieves a different result.

• Secondary character in Hamlet: Laertes, son of Polonius

Let's now try to break down some well-known stories to better understand how characters can be illuminated by contrast.

THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS

(Novel by Thomas Harris, screenplay by Ted Tally, 1991)

This is the story of a new FBI recruit named Clarice who is searching for a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill. On the advice of her boss, Jack, she decides to seek help from another serial killer already in prison, the infamous Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter. Hannibal initially appears hostile but eventually provides Clarice with training far superior to anything she could have received at the FBI.

• Heroine: Clarice Starling

• Main adversary: Buffalo Bill, the serial killer

• Second adversary: Dr. Chilton, the prison director

• False ally: None

• Ally: Jack, her superior at the FBI

• False adversary: Hannibal Lecter

• Secondary character: None

AMERICAN BEAUTY

(Alan Ball, 1999)

American Beauty is a dramatic comedy set in the suburbs. Lester's main adversaries are within his family: his wife, Carolyn, and his daughter, Jane, both of whom despise him. Lester soon falls for one of his daughter's friends, Angela. But since Lester is a married man and Angela is a teenager, she becomes a new adversary. Living close to Lester is the rigid and conservative Colonel Frank Fitts, who disapproves of Lester's lifestyle. Brad, Lester's colleague, tries to get him fired.

After blackmailing his company for better severance pay, Lester begins to live life as he pleases and finds an ally in Ricky Fitts, his neighbor, who sells him cannabis. Ricky and his father, Frank, are also secondary characters. Lester's central problem is determining how he could live a meaningful life in a highly conformist society that values only appearance and money. Ricky reacts to the military and dreary atmosphere of his home by selling drugs and spying on others with a camera. Frank represses his homosexual desires by imposing a strict discipline on himself and others.

• Hero: Lester

• Main adversary: Carolyn, his wife

• Second adversary: Jane, his daughter

• Third adversary: Angela, Jane's friend

• Fourth adversary: Colonel Frank Fitts

• Fifth adversary: Brad, his colleague

• Ally: Ricky Fitts

• False ally: None

• False adversary: None

• Secondary characters: Frank, Ricky

TECHNIQUE: TWO MAIN CHARACTERS

There are two popular genres or story forms that seem to involve the presence of two main characters: the love story and the friendship story. The friendship story is actually a combination of three genres: action, love, and comedy. Let's now try to understand how the character network functions in these two story forms, based on the role each protagonist plays in the narrative.

Love Stories

To create two equally well-developed characters, you must adhere to a number of imperatives throughout the character network. The function of the love story is to present to the audience the value of an alliance between two equal beings. The central concept of love stories is particularly profound. Love stories tell us that one cannot become a true individual alone. One can only become a unique and authentic individual by allying with another. It is through the love of the other that each can flourish and become their true self.

Expressing this beautiful idea with an appropriate character network is not an easy task. If you try to write a love story with two main characters, you will have two backbones, two lines of desire, two paths that the story will attempt to follow. It is therefore important to ensure that one of the characters is slightly more central than the other. You must define the needs of both characters at the beginning of the story, but you must give one of them the main line of desire. Most authors assign this thread to the man because, in our culture, it is the man who is supposed to court the woman. Thus, the best way to make your love story original is probably to give the line of desire to the woman, as in Moonstruck, Broadcast News, or Gone with the Wind.

When you assign a character the line of desire, you automatically make them the more powerful of the two characters. In terms of narrative functions, this means that the beloved, the person who is desired, is actually the main adversary, not a second hero. Generally, the character network is completed by creating one or more external adversaries, such as family members who oppose the union. There may also be other suitors seeking to win over the hero or the beloved, allowing for a comparison of different versions of desired and desirable men or women.

THE PHILADELPHIA STORY

(Play by Philip Barry, screenplay by Donald Ogden Stewart, 1940)

• Heroine: Tracy Lord

• Main adversary: Dexter, her ex-husband

• Second adversary: Mike, the reporter

• Ally: Her mother

• False adversary: Her father

• Secondary character: Liz, the photographer

• Hero: Michael

• Main adversary: Julie

• Second adversary: Ron, the director

• Third adversary: John, the doctor in the series

• Fourth adversary: Les, Julie's father

• False ally: Sandy

• Allies: George, Michael's agent; Jeff, his roommate

• False adversary: None

• Secondary characters: Ron, Sandy

Friendship Stories (Buddy Stories)

The strategy of using the relationship between two friends as the foundation of a character network is as old as the story of Gilgamesh and his great friend Enkidu. There is also the more unequal but highly edifying partnership of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, the dreamer and the realist, the master and the servant.

The friendship strategy essentially allows you to split the hero into two roles, showing two different approaches to life and two kinds of talents. The two characters are "married" into a team so that the audience can see their differences but also understand how these differences actually allow them to function better together, so that the whole is not just the sum of its parts.

As in the love story, one of the two characters must be more central than the other. This is generally the thinker, the schemer, or the strategist, because this character develops the plan and triggers the line of desire. The friend is a kind of double of the hero, similar in many ways but also different.

Structurally, the friend is both the main adversary and the main ally of the hero. He is not a second hero. But keep in mind that the opposition between the two friends is almost never serious or tragic. It generally takes the form of rather jovial bickering.

Generally, the character network is completed with at least one external, dangerous, and permanent adversary. And since most friendship stories use a journey with mythical value, the friends encounter many secondary adversaries along the way. These characters are most often people the two friends do not know, and they follow one another at a rapid pace. Each of these adversaries should represent a part of society that hates them or seeks to separate them. This technique is perfect for quickly defining secondary characters and distinguishing them from one another. It also allows for deepening and broadening the scope of the friendship story by defining various aspects of society through their relationship with the two main characters.

One of the most important elements of this character network is the fundamental conflict between the two friends. There must be a stumbling block in their relationship, a problem that constantly interferes. This allows for constant opposition between the two main characters while most other adversaries are strangers who appear and disappear immediately.

BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID

(William Goldman, 1969)

• Hero: Butch

• Main adversary: Sundance

• Second adversaries: The railroad chief, E. H. Harriman (who never appears) and his hidden henchmen, the posse led by Joe Lefors

• Third adversary: The Bolivian police and army

• False ally: Harvey, who questions Butch's position in the gang

• Ally: Etta, Sundance's girlfriend

• False adversary: Sheriff Ray

• Secondary characters: None

TECHNIQUE: MULTIPLE HEROES AND NARRATIVE DYNAMISM

While all popular genres have a single hero, there are stories that do not belong to a genre and have multiple heroes. Remember that in Chapter 1, we studied how stories unfold, with linear action and simultaneous action at opposite extremes. To create a sense of simultaneous narrative movement, the simplest way is to have multiple heroes. Instead of following the development of a single character (linear), the story compares the actions that several heroes undertake simultaneously. The risk is presenting so many characters at once that the story is no longer a story; it loses narrative dynamism. Even the most simultaneous stories must have some linear quality, with events following one another in time.

To succeed with a multiple-hero story, you must apply the seven steps of narrative structure to each main character – weaknesses and need, desire, adversary, plan, confrontation, realization, and new equilibrium. If not, your character is not a main character; the audience does not see them go through the inevitable stages of any development.

Be aware that having multiple heroes automatically slows down narrative dynamism. The more characters you present in detail, the more likely you are to see the pace of your story slow down.

However, there are certain techniques that can accelerate the narrative dynamism of a multiple-hero story:

• Have one character emerge throughout the story so that they appear more central than the others.

• Assign all characters the same line of desire.

• Make the hero of one narrative line the adversary of another narrative line.

• Connect the characters by making them all examples of a single subject or theme.

• Use suspense (cliffhanger) at the end of one narrative line to switch to another line.

• Bring distant characters together in one place.

• Reduce time. The story can, for example, take place over the course of a day or a night.

• Have characters occasionally meet by coincidence.

Here are some examples of multiple-hero stories that use one or more of these techniques: American Graffiti, Hannah and Her Sisters, L.A. Confidential, Pulp Fiction, The Canterbury Tales, La Ronde, Nashville, Crash, and Smiles of a Summer Night.

TECHNIQUE: ELIMINATING SUPERFLUOUS CHARACTERS

Superfluous characters are the primary cause of a fragmented story. The first question you must ask yourself when creating a character is: "Does he or she fulfill an important function in the overall story?" If not – if he or she does not provide more texture or color – you should consider eliminating them entirely. Their limited value would probably not justify the time they would take in the narrative line.

CHARACTER NETWORK BY ARCHETYPES

Contrasts and connections between characters are also established through archetypes. Archetypes are fundamental psychological models of personality; they are the roles a person can play in society, the essential ways of interacting with others. As they are common to all human beings, archetypes cross cultural boundaries and have universal reach.

Using archetypes as the foundation for creating your characters generally gives them weight very quickly because each type expresses a fundamental model that the audience recognizes, manifesting both in the character and in their interactions with society.

An archetype has a deep resonance for the audience, evoking strong feelings. But for the author, it is a somewhat crude tool in their repertoire. If the archetype is not enriched with details, it can quickly become a stereotype.

KEY POINT: Always specify the archetype to individualize it while respecting the unique character of your character.

Following the work of psychologist Carl Jung, many writers have explored the meaning of archetypes and the connections between them. For fiction writers, the most important concept when talking about archetypes is probably the notion of shadow. The shadow is the negative tendency of the archetype, a psychological trap one can fall into when playing the role of this archetype or obeying it.

We will now present the different major archetypes and their shadows and study them practically so that you can use them to create a story. We will therefore consider the different archetypes based on their beneficial role and the probable weaknesses each may have in a story.

The King or Father

• Strength: Governs his family or people with wisdom, insight, and determination so that each member can thrive and succeed.

• Inherent weaknesses: May force his wife, children, or people to conform to a set of strict and oppressive rules; may completely cut himself off from the emotional field of his family or kingdom; or may seek to force his family or people to live only for his pleasure.

• Examples: King Arthur, Zeus, The Tempest, The Godfather, Rick in Casablanca, King Lear, Hamlet, Aragorn and Sauron in The Lord of the Rings, Agamemnon in The Iliad, Citizen Kane, Star Wars, Stanley in A Streetcar Named Desire, American Beauty, Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman, Fort Apache, Meet Me in St. Louis, Mary Poppins, Tootsie, The Philadelphia Story, Othello, Red River, Howards End, Chinatown.

The Queen or Mother

• Strength: Weaves a cocoon of care and protection in which her children or people can thrive.

• Inherent weaknesses: Her need to protect and control can become tyrannical; she may play the guilt or shame card to keep her children close to her and ensure her own comfort.

• Examples: Hamlet, Macbeth, Hera, Stella in A Streetcar Named Desire, Elizabeth, American Beauty, The Lion in Winter, The Glass Menagerie, Long Day's Journey into Night, and Adam's Rib.

These archetypes can be male or female:

The Wise Old Man, Mentor, or Teacher

• Strength: Transmits his wisdom and knowledge so that individuals can improve their daily lives and societies can evolve positively.

• Inherent weaknesses: May force his disciples to think in a certain way or make his own apology rather than that of the ideas he should defend.

• Examples: Yoda in Star Wars, Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, The Matrix, Gandalf and Saruman in The Lord of the Rings, Wuthering Heights, Polonius in Hamlet, Homais in Madame Bovary, Miss Havisham in Great Expectations, Mr. Micawber in David Copperfield, and The Iliad.

The Warrior

• Strength: Is the physical champion of good.

• Inherent weaknesses: May live by the harsh principle of "Kill or be killed"; may believe that everything weak must be destroyed and thus become the champion of evil.

• Examples: Achilles and Hector in The Iliad; Luke Skywalker and Han Solo in Star Wars; The Seven Samurai; King Arthur; Thor; Ares; Theseus; Gilgamesh; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli in The Lord of the Rings; Patton; Die Hard; Sonny in The Godfather; A Streetcar Named Desire; The Great Santini; Shane; Platoon; Sundance in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid; Terminator and the Alien saga.

The Magician or Shaman

• Strength: Has the power to make deep reality visible, inaccessible to the senses, and can balance and control the hidden forces of nature.

• Inherent weaknesses: May manipulate deep reality to enslave others and destroy the natural order.

• Examples: Macbeth, the "Harry Potter" series, The Phantom of the Opera, Merlin, Star Wars, Chinatown, Vertigo, Gandalf and Saruman in The Lord of the Rings, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, The Conversation, and detectives like Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, and Nick Charles in The Thin Man.

The Trickster

The trickster is a derivative of the magician archetype and is extremely popular in modern fiction.

• Strength: Uses cunning, confidence, and the power of words to achieve his ends.

• Inherent weaknesses: May become a compulsive liar interested only in himself.

• Examples: Odysseus in The Odyssey, Men in Black, Beverly Hills Cop, Crocodile Dundee, Volpone, Loki in Norse mythology, Iago in Othello, Indiana Jones, Home Alone, Catch Me If You Can, Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, Br'er Rabbit, Butch in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Sergeant Bilko in The Phil Silvers Show, Michael in Tootsie, American Beauty, Verbal in The Usual Suspects, Oliver Twist, Vanity Fair, Tom Sawyer, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

The Artist or Clown

• Strength: Defines excellence for his people, or conversely, shows them what doesn't work; shows them beauty and a vision of the future, or that a beautiful appearance can hide stupidity and ugliness.

• Inherent weaknesses: May become a true fascist insisting on the notion of perfection; may create a world where everything can be controlled; or simply, by criticizing everything, may no longer value anything.

• Examples: Stephen in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man or Joyce's Ulysses, Achilles in The Iliad, Pygmalion, Frankenstein, King Lear, Hamlet, the sword master in The Seven Samurai, Michael in Tootsie, Blanche in A Streetcar Named Desire, Verbal in The Usual Suspects, Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye, The Philadelphia Story, and David Copperfield.

The Lover

• Strength: Provides the attention, understanding, and sensuality the other needs to become a happy and fulfilled person.

• Inherent weaknesses: May lose himself in the other or force the other to remain in the shadows.

• Examples: Paris in The Iliad, Heathcliff and Cathy in Wuthering Heights, Aphrodite, Romeo and Juliet, Etta in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Philadelphia Story, Hamlet, The English Patient, Kay in The Godfather, Camille, Moulin Rouge, Tootsie, Rick and Ilsa in Casablanca, Howards End, and Madame Bovary.

The Rebel

• Strength: Has the courage to detach from the masses and take action to fight against a system that oppresses the people.

• Inherent weaknesses: Often does not provide or cannot provide a better alternative and merely destroys the system or society.

• Examples: Prometheus, Loki, Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights, American Beauty, Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye, Achilles in The Iliad, Hamlet, Rick in Casablanca, Howards End, Madame Bovary, Rebel Without a Cause, Crime and Punishment, Notes from Underground, and Reds.

Here is a simple but effective example of a character network highlighting the contrast between archetypes:

STAR WARS

(George Lucas, 1977)

Luke (+ R2-D2 + C-3PO)

(prince-warrior-magician)

Darth Vader

(king-warrior-magician)

Han Solo (+ Chewbacca)

(rebel-warrior)

Princess Leia

(princess)

INDIVIDUALIZING CHARACTERS IN THE NETWORK

Once the oppositions between your essential characters are defined in the character network, you must transform the archetypes into real individuals. But again, you cannot create these unique individuals in isolation, from scratch, as if they all merely coexisted in the same story.

You must create your hero, your adversary, and your secondary characters by comparing them to each other, but this time first based on theme and opposition. We will study the theme in detail in Chapter 5, "The Moral Debate." But we must now take a closer look at some of the essential concepts of the notion of theme.

The theme expresses your point of view on how to act in the world, expressed through the actions undertaken by the characters in the story. The theme cannot be a subject, such as "racism" or "freedom." The theme is your moral vision, your idea of what is good or bad in terms of action, and it is unique to each of the stories you write.

KEY POINT: To individualize your characters, start by finding the moral problem at the heart of the premise. Then deploy the various possibilities of the moral problem throughout the story.

You deploy these various possibilities through opposition. In practice, you must create a group of adversaries (and allies) that forces the hero to confront the central moral problem. And all adversaries must be variations on the theme, each facing the same moral problem differently.

Let's now see how to put this crucial technique into practice.

1. Start by writing what you think is the central moral problem of your story. If you have studied the techniques of the premise, you should have already determined this problem.

2. Compare your hero to all other characters, and all characters to each other, based on these parameters:

• Their weaknesses

• Their need – both psychological and moral

• Their desire

• Their values

• Their power, status, and skills

• How each of them faces the central moral problem of the story
3. To make these comparisons, start with the most important relationship in any story, that of the hero and their main adversary. In many ways, this adversary is the key to creating your story because they represent the most effective way to define your hero, but also because they can help you create an excellent network of characters.

4. After comparing the hero to their main adversary, compare them to their other adversaries, then to their allies. Finish by comparing the adversaries and allies among themselves.

Remember that each character must present a different approach to the hero's central moral problem (variations on a single theme).

Let's look at some examples to better understand how this technique works.

TOOTSIE

(Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal, based on an original story by Don McGuire and Larry Gelbart, 1982)

Tootsie is an excellent example that demonstrates how you can start from a high-concept premise and create an organic story. It is a classic illustration of what is called switch comedy, a premise technique that suddenly reveals to the hero that they have changed (switch), becoming something or someone else. There are hundreds of switch comedies, a genre dating back at least to Mark Twain, who was a master of it.

But the vast majority of switch comedy authors fail miserably. This is because most of them ignore the major weakness of the high-concept premise: it only provides two or three scenes. The screenwriters of Tootsie, however, mastered the art of storytelling; they succeeded in creating a network of strong characters, each individualized through comparison with the others. As in all high-concept stories, Tootsie includes the two or three funny switch scenes, where Dustin Hoffman's character, Michael, dresses as a woman for the first time, auditions, and triumphantly meets his agent at the restaurant.

But the screenwriters of Tootsie created much more than two or three funny scenes. In working on the story, they began by giving Michael a central moral problem: how a man should behave towards women. The hero's moral problem is that he must learn to act properly with women, especially the one he falls in love with. The screenwriters then created several adversaries, each a variation on the theme of how men treat women or how women allow themselves to be treated by men. For example:

• Ron, the director, lies to Julie, cheats on her, then justifies himself by saying he would have hurt her even more if he had told her the truth.

• Julie, the actress Michael falls in love with, is beautiful and talented but lets men, especially Ron, take advantage of her and lead her by the nose.

• John, the actor playing the doctor, is a womanizer who uses his fame and status in the series to misbehave with the actresses he works with.

• Sandy, Michael's friend, has such a poor opinion of herself that when Michael lies and cheats on her, she apologizes.

• Les, Julie's father, falls in love with Michael (disguised as Dorothy) and treats him with the utmost respect when courting him with flowers and invitations to dance.

• Rita Marshall, the producer, is a woman who has repressed her femininity and attraction to other women to gain a position of power.

• Michael, disguised as Dorothy, helps the women in the series stand up to the men and gain the respect and love they deserve. But when Michael is dressed as a man, he courts all the women at once: he pretends to be attracted to Sandy, but only to try to keep Julie away from Ron.

GREAT EXPECTATIONS

(Charles Dickens, 1861)

Dickens, a great master of storytelling, is renowned for his networks of characters. His most instructive novel is undoubtedly Great Expectations, which probably features the most accomplished network of characters.

The distinctive mark of the character network in Great Expectations is the double pair of characters: Magwitch and Pip, Miss Havisham and Estella. The two protagonists of each pair have a fundamentally identical relationship—that of mentor to disciple—but this relationship is experienced very differently in each pair. Magwitch, the former convict, secretly gives Pip money and freedom, but not a sense of responsibility. Miss Havisham's excessive control over Estella, and her bitterness towards men, ultimately turn the young girl into a woman too cold to be capable of love.

VANITY FAIR

(William Makepeace Thackeray, 1847)

Thackeray referred to Vanity Fair as "a novel without a hero," by which he meant a novel without a heroic character worthy of emulation. All his characters represent variations of predatory animals trampling each other for money or power. This is what makes the entire network of characters in Vanity Fair unique. Note that the choice of this network is the most important means by which the author expressed his moral viewpoint and made it original.

Within the network, the main contrast between characters is that which opposes Becky and Amelia. Both have very different ideas about how a woman should find a husband. Amelia is immoral out of sheer stupidity, while Becky is immoral through calculation.

THE HISTORY OF TOM JONES, A FOUNDLING

(Henry Fielding, 1749)

The History of Tom Jones illustrates the immense impact that the choice of character network has on the hero. This comic "picaresque" novel features a very large number of characters. This great social factory generates multiple simultaneous but shallow actions. In comedies of this type, we discover the nature of the characters by watching them act foolishly and/or maliciously.

And this rule also applies to the hero. By making Tom a foolish innocent and basing the plot on false information about his identity, Fielding imposed limits on himself regarding the importance of awareness and depth he could give his hero. Tom still has a central moral problem—remaining faithful to his great love—but he has very little responsibility.

CREATING YOUR HERO

Creating on paper a main character that appears human is a complex task that involves going through several steps. Like a great painter, you must build your character in overlapping layers. You are more likely to succeed if you start from the outside, that is, from the network of characters. Whatever the nature of the character network you have built, it will have a strong impact on the hero that emerges from it, and it will guide you when you start detailing this main character.

Creating your hero, step 1:

The characteristics of a good hero

The first step is to ensure that your hero meets the requirements of any hero in any story; all of which relate to the function of the main character: they lead the story from beginning to end.

1. Your main character must always be fascinating

A character who drives the action must necessarily attract and hold the audience's attention at all times. There should be no downtime, pauses, or pointless filler (nor metaphors that state the obvious). From the moment your hero becomes boring, the story stops.

The best way to attract and hold the audience's attention is undoubtedly to make the hero mysterious, showing the audience that this character is hiding something. This tends to force the reader or viewer not to remain passive and to actively participate in the story. They should be able to say: "This character is hiding something, and I want to find out what it is."

2. The audience must identify with the character, but not too much

"Identify" is a term that many people throw around, but few know how to define. We think that readers or viewers must identify with the hero to become emotionally attached to this character. But what does that really mean?

People who think characters are created by accumulating characteristics also think the audience identifies with distinctive marks such as social origin, job, clothing, standard of living, race, and gender. Nothing could be further from the truth. If identification were based on such distinctive marks, no one could identify with anyone, as characters have too many characteristics for a reader or viewer to share them all.

A reader or viewer identifies with a character based on two elements: their desire and the moral problem they must face—in short, the desire and the need, the first two of the seven major steps of narrative structure. It is the desire that drives the story as the audience wants the hero to succeed. The moral problem is how one should behave with others, a problem the audience wants the hero to resolve.

Be careful, however, that the audience does not identify too much with the character: they would then be unable to step back and see the transformation and evolution that have occurred in them. Once again, Peter Brook's advice to actors provides excellent lessons for authors:

When [the actor] considers himself in relation to the whole play [...], he takes a different look at the characteristics he shares or does not share with the character, and ultimately, he makes different decisions than he would have if he always thought that "identification" with the character was all that mattered.

We will explain in Chapter 8, "The Plot," how to create distance between the audience and the hero at the most appropriate moment in the story.

3. The audience must feel empathy for the hero, not sympathy

Everyone talks about the need to make the hero sympathetic. Having a sympathetic hero (compassion) can be considered positive as the audience will want them to achieve their goal. Because the audience participates in the storytelling.

But it should be noted that some of the most memorable heroes in literature and cinema are not at all sympathetic. And they remain fascinating nonetheless. There are also stories where the hero is initially sympathetic but then begins to act immorally—becoming unsympathetic—when they lose a battle to their adversary. But the audience does not close the book or leave the theater for all that.

KEY POINT: What matters is that the audience understands the character, not necessarily that they approve of everything they do.

Feeling empathy means being interested in someone and understanding them. Thus, to hold the audience's attention—even when the hero is not sympathetic or acts immorally—you must show what motivates the character's actions.

KEY POINT: Always explain why your hero acts as they do.

Showing the reader or viewer why the character chooses to do what they do allows them to understand the cause of the action (empathy) without necessarily approving the action itself (sympathy).

Showing the hero's motivations to the audience does not mean showing them to the hero themselves. Often, at first, the hero is unaware of the true reason driving them to achieve the goal and only discovers their true motivation at the end of the story, at the moment of realization.

4. Your hero must have a moral and psychological need

The most memorable characters all have a moral and psychological need. Remember the difference between the two: the psychological need affects only the hero; the moral need involves learning to act correctly towards others. By giving your hero a need that is both moral and psychological, you increase the character's impact on the story and, in turn, increase the emotional power of the story.

Creating your hero, step 2:

The transformation of the character

"Character transformation," also known as "character arc," "character development," or "range of transformation," refers to the character's development throughout the story. This is undoubtedly the most difficult but also the most important of all the steps in the writing process.

"Character development," like "identification," is one of those expressions that everyone uses but no one seems able to define. Let's return for a moment to the standard technique of character creation, where the author imagines an isolated person and then tries to list all the characteristics they could be endowed with. The author tells the story of this person and makes them undergo a transformation at the end. This is what we call "the school of small change." A change is inserted in the last scene, and presto, the character is transformed. This technique does not work, which is why we will try to explore another one.

The self expressed as a character

Before discussing the true transformation of the character and the techniques to create it, we must first get an idea of what the self is, since it is this self that will be transformed. And for this, we must ask: what is the role of the self in a narrative?

A character is a fictional being, created to simultaneously show that a human being is completely unique in an unlimited number of ways, yet remains always a human being, endowed with characteristics we all share. This fictional self is then put into action, in space and time, and compared to others to show how a person can lead a good or bad life and how they can continue to grow throughout their existence, even after they have stopped physical growth.

Unsurprisingly, there is no monolithic conception of the self in the history of fiction. Below are some of the most important views on the self. In fiction, the self can be:

• An individual unit of personality, internally governed with an iron hand. The self is clearly separated from others but seeks to fulfill its "destiny." This is what the self was born for, what it was endowed with its various talents and abilities for. This idea of the self is very common in myths, whose heroes are often warriors.

• An individual unit composed of many often contradictory desires and needs. The self has a strong desire to connect with others and sometimes even to encompass another. This conception of the self is found in a wide variety of stories, but particularly in the work of modern playwrights such as Ibsen, Chekhov, Strindberg, O'Neill, and Williams.

• A series of roles played by the person according to what society demands at the moment. Twain is perhaps the most famous representative of this view. His switch comedies A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court and The Prince and the Pauper were created to demonstrate that people are largely determined by the position they occupy in society. And even in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, Twain emphasizes the power of the roles we play and how society often dictates our being.

• An accumulation of images so unstable, porous, malleable, weak, and inconsistent that it can metamorphose into something completely different. Kafka, Borges, and Faulkner are the greatest representatives of this sense of the self. In popular fiction, this self is found in horror stories, particularly those dealing with vampires, cat people, and werewolves.

If these various notions of the self present significant differences, the goal of character transformation and the techniques to achieve it are relatively similar for each of them.

KEY POINT: Character transformation does not occur at the end of the story; it occurs at the beginning, or more precisely, it is made possible from the beginning by the way you prepare it.

KEY POINT: Do not conceive your main character as a fixed and determined person whose story you will then tell. You must think of your hero as a range of transformation, a range of possibilities, from the very beginning. You must determine the range of transformation from the start of the writing process, otherwise, the hero will not be able to undergo their transformation at the end of the story.

We cannot emphasize enough the importance of this technique. If you manage to master the range of transformation, you will win the "game" of storytelling. If not, no matter how much you revise and rewrite, you will never achieve a correct result.

Also, consider this simple rule: the narrower the range of transformation, the less interesting the story; the wider the range, the more interesting the story, but the greater the risk, as characters do not change much in the limited time frame in which they appear in most stories.

But what exactly does "range of transformation" mean? It refers to the "different possibilities of self" of the character, possibilities defined by their understanding of themselves. Character transformation is the moment when the hero finally becomes who they must be. In other words, the main character cannot suddenly become someone else (except on rare occasions). The main character completes a transformation process that occurs throughout the story and allows them to become themselves more deeply and precisely.

This process by which the hero becomes themselves but more deeply can seem ridiculously ethereal, which is why it is often misunderstood. We will therefore be very precise: your character can undergo several transformations throughout your story, but not all will be "character transformations."

For example, you can present a character who starts poor and ends rich. Or a peasant who becomes king. Or an alcoholic who learns to become sober. All these evolutions are transformations. But not all these transformations are character transformations.

KEY POINT: A true character transformation involves questioning and modifying their fundamental beliefs, leading the hero to adopt new moral behavior.

A character's self-knowledge is based on their beliefs about the world and themselves. What they believe they must do to lead a good life and what they believe they must do to get what they want. In good stories, as the hero seeks to achieve their goal, they are forced to question their deepest beliefs. Pushed to their limits, they discover what they truly believe in, the values that must guide their actions, and then act according to this new moral code.

If authors have been able to express different versions of the self, they have also used different strategies to express character transformation. We wrote in Chapter 1 that the story "walked" on two "legs," action and discovery. We can say that, generally, in the long history of fiction, we have moved from stories almost exclusively based on action—with myth, the audience learns simply by taking example from the hero's actions—to narratives placing much more emphasis on discovery, where the audience's main concern is first to determine what exactly is happening, who these characters really are, what the true nature of the events occurring is, before drawing conclusions on how to lead one's life.

These discovery-based stories are found in authors like Joyce, Woolf, Faulkner, Godard, Stoppard, Frayn, and Ayckbourn, as well as in films as diverse as Last Year at Marienbad, Blow-Up, The Conformist, Memento, The Conversation, and The Usual Suspects.

For readers or viewers, character transformation in discovery-based stories does not simply involve watching the hero gain a piece of self-understanding at the end of the story. The audience must truly participate in the transformation by becoming several characters throughout the story, not just by experiencing their different points of view, but also by having to determine which point of view they are sharing.

The possibilities for character transformations are limitless. The development of your hero depends on their starting beliefs, how they question them, and how they transform them at the end of the story. This is how you can make your story unique and truly yours.

But some types of character transformations are more common than others. We will now study some of them, not because you must necessarily use them in one of your stories, but because understanding them will help you better master this major technique.

1. From child to adult Also known as a coming-of-age story, this type of transformation has, of course, absolutely nothing to do with a child physically becoming an adult. You may think this is an obvious fact, but many authors of coming-of-age stories make the mistake of defining their character's development through their first sexual experience. Although this experience can be tragic or amusing, it has nothing to do with character transformation.

A true coming-of-age story presents a young person questioning their fundamental beliefs and modifying them before acting according to this new moral code. This type of transformation can be observed in stories such as The Catcher in the Rye, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, David Copperfield, The Sixth Sense, Big, Good Will Hunting, Forrest Gump, Scent of a Woman, Stand by Me, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (which is not only the first coming-of-age novel but also the first anti-coming-of-age novel!).
2. From Adult to Leader

During this transformation, a character who is only concerned with finding the right path for themselves realizes they must also help others find that path. This type of transformation can be observed in Matrix, Saving Private Ryan, Elizabeth, Braveheart, Forrest Gump, Schindler's List, The Lion King, The Grapes of Wrath, Dances with Wolves, and Hamlet.

3. From Cynic to Committed

This development is actually a specialized form of the previous one. But in this specific case, the character starts as someone who is only interested in themselves. They are detached from the rest of society and only think about their well-being, freedom, and money. By the end of the story, this hero has understood the importance of doing good in the world and has joined society as a leader. Stories like Casablanca and the character of Han Solo in Star Wars are good examples of this transformation.

4. From Leader to Tyrant

Not all character transformations are positive. In stories of this type, a character who helps others find the right path ends up forcing others to follow their own path. Many actors fear playing this type of transformation, thinking it might make them appear villainous. Yet, this development can give rise to excellent dramas. L.A. Confidential, A Few Good Men, Howards End, Red River, The Godfather, and Macbeth are good illustrations.

5. From Leader to Visionary

Through this transformation, a character who initially helps others find the right path eventually understands how society as a whole must evolve and live its future. Examples of this type can be found in religious stories and some creation myths.

Many authors use the story structure of Moses to depict this transformation. In Close Encounters of the Third Kind, for example, we find an ordinary man, Roy, who has a vision on a mountain. He climbs the mountain and, at its peak, sees the future of the universe in the form of a giant spaceship.

But beware! If you want your character to become a visionary, you must overcome a major problem: you must define the nature of their vision. Most authors who attempt to tell this type of story are quite surprised when they reach the end to discover they have no clear vision of how they would like society as a whole to act in the future. So, at the moment of final realization, they show their character a white light or beautiful images of nature.

This cannot work. The character's vision must be a clear and precise moral vision. Moses' Ten Commandments are ten moral laws. Jesus' Sermon on the Mount corresponds to a series of moral laws. If you have no idea of this kind, do not embark on writing this type of story.

6. Metamorphosis

In horror and fantasy stories, fairy tales, and some intense psychological dramas, the character undergoes a metamorphosis, that is, an extreme transformation. The hero truly becomes another person, an animal, or even an object.

This radical transformation requires a self that is initially weak, fractured, or devastated. If positive, this development presents an act of extreme empathy. If negative, it marks the complete destruction of the old self, trapped in the new.

In horror stories such as The Wolf Man, Wolfen, and The Fly, the transformation of the human into an animal marks a total surrender to sexual passion and predatory instinct. We observe the regression of man returning to his animal roots.

There are only rare examples of characters who metamorphose in the opposite direction, from beast to human. King Kong is undoubtedly one of these characters, when he falls in love with the young woman played by Fay Wray and dies to stay with her. "It was beauty killed the beast," declares the producer in his more predatory style. The wild child of Mad Max 2 is an animal child who learns to become human by observing Mad Max, but also ends up becoming the leader of his tribe. In Gilgamesh, Enkidu, the animal man, becomes human after being pushed to sleep with a woman.

In Kafka's Metamorphosis, a novel that could be called a "switch tragedy," the traveling salesman Gregor Samsa discovers one morning that he has been transformed into an insect. This is a rare example of character transformation occurring at the beginning of the story, with the rest of the narrative devoted to the experience of being an insect (reportedly, the height of alienation).

For extreme transformations of this type, the use of a symbol is absolutely necessary. Refer to chapter 7 to understand how to attach a symbol to a character.

Creating a Character Transformation in Your Story

Now that we know how character transformation works in storytelling, the question remains: how to construct this transformation in your story?

In chapter 2, dedicated to the premise, we explored the technique of going to the opposite of the main action of the story to get an idea of the possible transformations the hero can undergo. Remember that The Godfather works this way:

• Premise: The youngest son of a mafia family avenges the men who shot his father and becomes the new Godfather.

F – initial weaknesses: cautious, conventional, isolated from the rest of the family

A – main action: revenge

T – transformation: tyrannical, becomes the undisputed head of the family.

Then, in chapter 3, we saw how to use the seven structural steps for the character to lead the plot and simultaneously experience a profound change. We will now explain in more detail the techniques for creating the character transformation that will serve as the foundation for your story.

When we talked about building the transformation earlier, we used the verb "build" deliberately because this transformation must literally form the framework of your story.

KEY POINT: Always start from the end of the transformation, that is, the realization; then go back to the beginning and determine the starting point of the transformation, that is, the hero's need and desire; and finally, imagine the development steps that lie between this beginning and this end.

This is one of the most effective techniques in fiction writing. Use it, and you will progress remarkably. If you must start from the endpoint, it is because every story is a journey of learning (which may or may not be accompanied by a real journey) undertaken by the hero. As with any journey, before taking the first step, you must know the final destination. Otherwise, you go in circles or wander aimlessly.

By starting with the realization, the end of the transformation, you ensure that each of your character's steps brings them closer to this end. There will be no treading water, no filler, no unnecessary things. This is the only way to make the story organic (with an internal logic), to ensure that each step of the journey is well connected to all the others and that this journey builds up.

Some authors fear this technique: they imagine it is restrictive and forces them to write schematically. The truth is that this technique provides more freedom because it guarantees a certain security. Wherever you are in the story, you know your final destination. You can therefore take risks and try to tell events that might seem like digressions but actually bring you more creatively to where you need to go.

Remember that the realization is made possible at the beginning of the story. This means that a good realization consists of two parts: the realization itself and its preparation.

The moment of realization must have the following qualities:

• Be sudden to have maximum dramatic impact on the hero and the audience.

• Create an emotional explosion in the audience, who shares the realization with the hero.

• Bring new information to the hero, who must realize, for the first time, that they have lied to themselves and hurt others.

• Prompt the hero to act immediately according to their new moral code, to prove that the realization has indeed occurred and has profoundly transformed them.

The preparation for the realization must meet the following criteria:

• The hero must be a rational person, capable of recognizing the truth and discerning right from wrong.

• The hero must be hiding something from themselves.

• This lie or illusion must hurt the hero deeply.

You may have noticed what may seem like a contradiction: a rational person who lies to themselves. This may indeed seem contradictory, but it is what happens in reality. We all suffer from this. The greatest power of fiction is undoubtedly to show that a human being capable of reasoning brilliantly and creatively is also susceptible to confusion and self-enslavement in illusion.

TECHNIQUE: THE DOUBLE REVERSAL

To achieve a character transformation, the most common technique is to provide the hero with a need and a realization. The hero then questions their fundamental beliefs, which they modify before acting according to a new moral code. And as readers or viewers identify with the hero, they learn what the hero learns.

But a problem remains: how to express your own moral point of view as an author on what is right or wrong if it is distinct from that of the hero? The author's and hero's points of view are not necessarily the same. And you may also want to express the transformation by giving it more complexity and emotional impact than the standard method allows.

There is thus another type of realization, quite unique, that I call "double reversal." This more advanced technique involves giving a realization to both the hero and their adversary. Each character learns something from the other, and instead of a single vision of things, the audience receives two different points of view on the appropriate way to act and live in the world.

Compared to the standard method of single realization, the double reversal technique has two advantages. First, by using the comparative method, you present the audience with the appropriate way to be and act with more subtlety and clarity. It's like the difference between mono and stereo sound. Then, the audience is not confined to the hero's point of view. They can more easily step back and consider the whole picture, reflecting on the story's ramifications.

To create a double reversal, follow these steps:

1. Give the hero and their main adversary a weakness and a need (the hero's and adversary's weaknesses and needs do not necessarily have to be similar).

2. Make the adversary human: they must be capable of learning and changing.

3. During the confrontation, or just after, give a realization to both the hero and the adversary.

4. Connect the two realizations: the hero must learn something from the adversary, and the adversary must learn something from the hero.

5. Your moral point of view will correspond to the best of what both characters have learned.

The double reversal is a very powerful technique but quite uncommon. Most authors do not create adversaries capable of having a realization. If your adversary is evil, fundamentally and totally bad, they can never discover they were wrong. An adversary who pounces on people to rip out their hearts and make them their snack cannot realize they need to change.

Quite unsurprisingly, love stories provide the best uses of the double reversal. Love stories are designed for the hero and the loved one (the main adversary) to learn from each other. Good examples of double reversal can be found in films such as Kramer vs. Kramer; Adam's Rib; Pride and Prejudice; Casablanca; Pretty Woman; Sex, Lies, and Videotape; Scent of a Woman; and The Music Man.

Once your hero's realization is determined, you must return to the need. Creating the realization first gives a notable advantage: it automatically determines the hero's need. If the realization is what the hero learns, the need is what the hero does not yet know but must learn to live better. Your hero must understand the great illusion dominating their life to overcome the great weakness that spoils it.

Creating Your Hero, Step 3: Desire

The third step in creating a strong hero is to build their line of desire. In chapter 3, we compared this step to the backbone of the story. To create a strong line of desire, keep these three rules in mind:

1. The story must have only one line of desire, which gradually grows in importance and intensity. If your story has multiple lines of desire, it will lose all cohesion. It will literally go in two or three directions at once, and this lack of narrative drive will leave the audience disoriented. In good stories, the hero has only one main goal, which they pursue with increasing intensity. The story moves faster and faster, and the narrative drive grows stronger.

2. The desire must be precise—and the more precise, the better. To ensure your line of desire is precise enough, ask yourself if there is a specific moment in your story when the audience learns whether the hero has achieved their goal. In Top Gun, we know the hero has failed in his desire to win the top prize at flight school when the director awards it to someone else. In Flashdance, we know the heroine has fulfilled her desire to join the dance school as soon as she receives a letter informing her.

Some authors say things like: "My hero's desire is to become independent." Let's apply the rule of the specific moment: when can you say a person becomes independent in life? When they leave home for the first time? When they get married? When they get divorced? There is no specific moment when you can say a person becomes independent. Dependence or independence is more related to need and offers little in terms of desire.

3. The desire must be fulfilled—if you think it should be—towards the end of the story. If the hero achieves their goal in the middle of the story, you must either stop the story or create a new line of desire, in which case you have mixed two stories together. By extending the line of desire almost to the end of the story, you give your narrative a unity that ensures enormous narrative drive.

The line of desire in each of the following films meets these three criteria:

• Saving Private Ryan: find Private Ryan and bring him back alive.

• The Full Monty: make a lot of money by dancing naked in front of a room full of women.

• The Verdict: win the trial.

• Chinatown: determine the identity of Hollis's mysterious killer.

• The Godfather: avenge the men who shot Vito Corleone.

Creating Your Hero, Step 4: The Adversary

I am not exaggerating when I say that it is the adversary who defines the hero and determines your entire story. Of all the relationships between characters in the network, the most important is that of the hero and their main adversary. This relationship determines how the entire story is constructed.

That's why, as an author, you must love this character: they will help you in many ways. From a structural point of view, it is always the adversary who holds the key because it is through them that the hero learns. It is only because the adversary attacks the hero's major weakness that the hero is forced to consider it and evolve.

KEY POINT: To have a good main character, they need a good adversary.

To better understand the importance of this principle, imagine the hero and the adversary are tennis players. If the hero is the best player in the world and the adversary is a casual player, the hero will hit a few balls, the adversary will try to return them in vain, and the audience will quickly get bored. But if the adversary is the second-best player in the world, the hero will be forced to bring out their best shots, the adversary will counterattack with spectacular shots, and the audience will be thrilled.

This is exactly how good stories work. The hero and their adversary push each other to greater heights.

The story can only unfold once the relationship between the hero and their adversary is defined. If this relationship is well-defined, the story has every chance of working. If this relationship is poorly defined, the story will almost certainly fail. We will therefore study the elements you need to create a good adversary.

1. Make the Adversary Necessary

The most important characteristic of a good adversary is that they must be necessary to the hero. In structural terms, this has a very precise meaning: the main adversary is the person most capable of attacking the hero's major weakness. And they must attack it relentlessly, constantly. The necessary adversary forces the hero to overcome their weakness or destroys them. In other words, the necessary adversary allows the hero to grow.

2. Make the Adversary Human

"Human" does not just mean that they are a person, as opposed to an animal, object, or phenomenon. A human adversary is as complex and interesting as the hero.

From a structural point of view, this means that a human adversary is always, in some way, a "double" of the hero. Some authors have used this concept of a double—also called a doppelgänger—to create certain characters. But this is a broader technique, one of the first principles to apply to create a hero-adversary pair. The concept of a double provides a number of points on which the hero and adversary can be compared, better defining each other by contrast:

• The double-adversary has certain weaknesses that lead them to behave poorly towards others or commit actions that prevent them from leading a better life.

• Like the hero, the double-adversary has a need based on this weakness.

• The double-adversary must desire something, preferably the same goal as the hero.

• The double-adversary must have a lot of power, high status, or great skill to put the hero under pressure, allow for a final confrontation, and give success (or failure) more significance.

3. Give the Adversary Values Opposed to Those of the Hero

The actions of the hero and the adversary are based on a set of beliefs or values. These values represent each character's point of view on what makes life worth living.

In good stories, the adversary's values conflict with those of the hero. It is through this conflict that the audience determines which lifestyle is superior. The success of the story largely depends on the quality of this opposition.

4. Put a Convincing but Erroneous Moral Argument in the Adversary's Mouth

An evil adversary is a fundamentally bad being, and therefore mechanical and uninteresting. In most real conflicts, there is not really right and wrong, good and bad. In well-written stories, both the hero and the adversary think they are right, and both have good reasons to believe so. Both are wrong, but in different ways.

The adversary tries to justify their actions from a moral point of view, just as the hero does. Good authors detail the adversary's moral arguments, making them strong and convincing but ultimately erroneous (we will explain how in the next chapter, "The Moral Debate").

5. Make the Hero and Adversary Similar in Some Aspects

The contrast between the hero and the adversary is only interesting if it opposes two beings with strong similarities. Each of them then symbolizes a slightly different approach to the same problem. And it is in the similarity that the determining and instructive differences become clear.

By giving the hero and their adversary certain similar traits, you also prevent yourself from conceiving a completely good hero and a completely bad adversary. You should never think of the hero and adversary as extreme opposites. They are rather two possibilities in a range of possibilities. The conflict between the hero and the adversary is not a conflict between good and evil but one between two characters who have weaknesses and needs.

6. Place the Adversary in the Same Location as the Hero

This goes against common sense. When two people dislike each other, they tend to go in opposite directions. But if this is the case in your story, you will have great difficulty building the conflict. The right technique is to find a natural reason why the hero and their adversary remain in the same place throughout the story.

The character of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs offers a good example of how the adversary acts on the hero. Ironically, in this film, Lecter is not a true adversary. He is actually a false adversary, a character who seems to be Clarice's adversary but is actually her greatest friend. We like to think of Lecter as an evil Yoda; the training he gives Clarice, though brutal, is far more instructive than anything she could have learned at the FBI Academy.
But in his first meeting with Clarice, Lecter perfectly illustrates, through mise en abyme, the role of the adversary: to constantly attack the weaknesses of the heroine until she either fixes them or collapses. Clarice visits Lecter in his cell to obtain information about the serial killer Buffalo Bill. After a promising start, she overestimates her chances and insults Lecter's intelligence. He counterattacks:

LECTER: Agent Starling, do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?

CLARICE: No. I thought your knowledge...

LECTER: You're very ambitious, aren't you? Do you know what you look like with your cheap handbag and shoes? Like a rube. A well-scrubbed, hustling rube with little taste. Good nutrition has given you some length of bone, but you're not more than one generation
Blanche: Beauty, appearances, good manners, refinement, kindness, Stella.

Stanley: Strength, power, women, sex, Stella, his friends.

Stella: Stanley, her marriage, Blanche, sex, her baby.

Mitch: His mother, his friends, good manners, Blanche.

• Similarities between the adversaries and the heroine

Stanley: Blanche and Stanley are different in many ways, but they share a deep understanding of the world, which Stella lacks. They are both very skilled at making calculations and recognizing this ability in each other.

Stella: Stella shares Blanche's past, the time when they both lived in the charming and graceful world of the old Southern aristocracy. Stella and Blanche also share a need for love and kindness.

Mitch: Mitch appeals to Blanche's taste for good manners and courtesy. He appreciates her refinement and the last remnants of her beauty.

• Power, social status, and skills

Blanche: Blanche has lost her social status. She clings desperately to her ability to please men through her looks and charm.

Stanley: Stanley is the leader of his circle of friends. He is also very skilled at getting what he wants, especially from Stella.

Stella: Stella has no power, except what Stanley is willing to grant her. But she is very skilled at pleasing Stanley.

Mitch: Mitch has little power over his circle of friends or the world. He is a natural follower.

• Moral problem and justification

Blanche: Blanche believes her lies hurt no one and are her only chance at achieving happiness.

Stanley: He believes Blanche is a prostitute who tried to deceive him. He thinks he is doing the right thing and protecting his friend Mitch when he reveals Blanche's past to him.

Stella: Stella is not intelligent enough to realize she has participated in a process that is destroying her sister.

Mitch: Mitch believes that a woman who has acted like a prostitute can be treated like a prostitute.

• Variations of secondary characters on the heroine's weakness and moral problem Eunice and Steve are married and live upstairs. They argue about infidelity. When Eunice leaves the home, Steve catches up with her and brings her back.

• Four-corner opposition

The connection of two symbols presents the same advantages as a journey: the symbols are the two opposing poles of a moral sequence. This technique is generally used to signify a decline in morality. But it can also mark an upward movement. The author of Heart of Darkness used the technique of the journey, but also that of the two symbols, to express his thematic line. Implicated by the very title of the work, the two symbols, the dark heart and the center of moral darkness, suggest an investigation into human depravity.

There are other guiding principles—units of time, use of a narrator, or a particular way of unfolding the story—that can also help you clarify your thematic line. We will now return to the guiding principles of stories we discussed in Chapter 2 (The Premise) to reflect on the thematic lines they can generate.

MOSES IN THE BOOK OF EXODUS

• Guiding Principle A man who does not know who he is struggles to free his people and receives new moral laws that will define him and his people.

• Guiding Principle Use multiple narrators to demonstrate that one can never truly know a man's life.

• Thematic Line People who try to force others to love them end up alone.

DIVIDING THE THEME INTO OPPOSITIONS

The thematic line is your moral debate condensed into a single sentence. Once this line is defined, you must express it in dramatic terms. To do this, you must divide it into a set of oppositions, then link these thematic oppositions to the hero and their adversaries during their confrontations.

Three techniques can help you divide the thematic line into dramatic oppositions: assign the hero a moral decision, make each character a variation on the theme, and put the characters' values in conflict.

The hero's moral decision

The hero's moral development begins with the moral need at the beginning of the story and ends with a moral decision at the end, following a moral awakening. This thread, that of the fundamental moral lesson you wish to express, provides the framework, the moral fabric of your story.

To express the hero's moral line in dramatic terms, the classic strategy is to assign them a moral imperfection from the start and then show how their rage to defeat the adversary brings out the worst in them. In short, the hero must be capable of the worst before revealing the best. Slowly but surely, they realize that their central moral problem boils down to a choice between two ways of acting.

No matter how complex the characters' actions are throughout the story, the final moral decision boils everything down to a binary choice. That's it. The moral decision is thus somewhat the funnel's end for your theme. The two options are the two most important moral actions available to your hero. They therefore provide you with the major thematic opposition of your story.

This major decision usually comes right after the moment of moral awakening, which makes the hero aware of the choice they have to make. On rare occasions, the choice comes first, and the hero's awakening only recognizes that they made the right or wrong choice.

KEY POINT: Since the culmination of the moral line is the final choice, you must start by determining the moral oppositions using this choice.

• Casablanca: When Rick reunites with Ilsa, his former love, he has the option to use two exit visas to escape with her and return to America. But Rick chooses to fight the Nazis rather than give in to his love for Ilsa.

• The Maltese Falcon: Private detective Sam Spade discovers that Brigid O’Shaughnessy killed her lover. When the police come to him, he has to choose between justice and the woman he loves. He chooses justice.

• Sophie's Choice: Sophie tells an American writer about her past as a prisoner in Auschwitz concentration camp. Upon her arrival, she had to choose between two negative possibilities: which of her children will she let the Nazis kill? (One could argue that this is not a real choice.)

• The Iliad: During the final confrontation, Achilles kills Hector, the great Trojan warrior, then drags his body behind his chariot. He allows Hector's father, Priam, to retrieve his son's body so he can have a decent burial.

• Vertigo: Scottie discovers that his lover, Madeleine, helped a man kill his wife. At the end of the story, his moral decision comes before the awakening. He decides not to forgive Madeleine and is destroyed when he realizes he made the wrong choice and, by that choice, killed the woman he loved.

Characters as variations of the theme

Once you have determined, by examining the hero's final moral choice, the deepest moral opposition of the story, you must detail it through the network of main characters by making each of them a variation on the theme. Here's how to make this technique work:

1. Review the hero's final moral decision and the work you did on the premise to be clear about the central moral problem the hero must face.

2. Ensure that all main characters face the same moral problem, each doing so in a different way.

3. Start by comparing the hero to their main adversary, these two characters embodying the basic moral opposition you will detail in your story. Then compare the hero to their other adversaries.

4. Throughout the story, each of the main characters must engage in a moral debate in the dialogue to justify their actions towards the goal (a good moral debate is conducted mainly, but not exclusively, through structure. We will explain how to write moral dialogue in Chapter 10, "Building Scenes and Symphonic Dialogues").

TOOTSIE

(Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal, based on an original story by Don McGuire and Larry Gelbart, 1982)

Tootsie tells the story of an actor who disguises himself as a woman to get a role in a TV series. But he falls in love with an actress from the series, and several men, who take him for a woman, are attracted to him.

The hero's central moral problem is determining how men should behave with women in love. Each adversary and ally represents a possible behavior towards women or a reaction to that behavior.

L.A. CONFIDENTIAL

(novel by James Ellroy, screenplay by Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson, 1997)

In L.A. Confidential, three police inspectors investigate a massacre. These three characters are three heroes who must face the central moral problem of administering justice. Bud is a cop who enforces the law alone, assuming the role of judge and executioner. Jack has forgotten why he became a cop and arrests people for money. Ed wants to bring the guilty to justice, but he has gotten caught up in the political game of justice and now aims for the top of the profession. The other main characters represent other variations on the theme of justice corruption.

DANCES WITH WOLVES

(novel and screenplay by Michael Blake, 1990)

Dances with Wolves recounts the exploits of a U.S. Army officer at the end of the 19th century. Gradually, this man will embrace the Sioux way of life, a people he initially considered his enemy.

The hero's central moral problem is how to behave towards another people, another culture, towards animals and nature. Each adversary and ally has a different approach to this problem.

The characters' values in conflict

Using your network of characters, you can now put each main character's values in conflict with those of their rivals, who seek to achieve the same goal.

1. Assign your hero and each of the other main characters a set of values. Define values as deeply held beliefs about what constitutes a happy life.

2. Try to give each character a set of values.

3. Ensure these sets of values are as different as possible.

4. Consider that when your hero and their adversaries fight to achieve the goal, their values must come into direct conflict.

IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE

(short story, The Greatest Gift, by Philip Van Doren Stern, screenplay by Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Frank Capra, 1946)

Disgusted with living in a small town ruled by a tyrant, George Bailey is about to commit suicide when an angel appears to him and shows him what the world would have been like if he had never lived.

The hero and the adversary fight for the town they live in based on very different values:

• George Bailey (Bedford Falls): Democracy, decency, kindness, work, importance of the average worker

• Mr. Potter (Pottersville): Tyranny, money, power, survival of the fittest

THE CHERRY ORCHARD

(Anton Chekhov, 1904)

In The Cherry Orchard, a family of poor aristocrats returns to their land to try to save it from bankruptcy.

The different characters fight for control of the land. The focal point of the competition is the value of the cherry orchard. Madame Ranevsky and her family love it for its immense beauty and the childhood memories attached to it. Lopakhine loves it only for its practical and financial value; he wants to cut down the cherry trees to build small houses he could rent.

• Madame Ranevsky: True love, beauty, past

• Lopakhine: Money, social status, power, practicality, future

• Varia: Work, family, marriage, practicality

• Trofimov: Truth, learning, compassion, higher love

• Ania: Her mother, kindness, higher love

FIELD OF DREAMS

(short story, Shoeless Joe, by W. P. Kinsella, screenplay by Phil Alden Robinson, 1989)

Field of Dreams is an American version of The Cherry Orchard where the land ends up "winning." In this story, the competition revolves around the value of the farm Ray has turned into a baseball field.

• Ray: Baseball, family, passion for dreams

• Mark: Money, practical use of the land

With characters representing variations on the same theme and value oppositions, you can use the four-corner opposition technique explained in Chapter 4. You will then need a hero, a main adversary, and at least two secondary adversaries. This technique can provide organic unity to the most complex story. Each of the four main characters can represent a fundamentally different approach to the same moral problem, and each can express an entire system of values without the story fragmenting into a complicated mess.

KEY POINT: Your moral debate will always seem simplistic if you use a binary opposition, like good versus evil. Only a network of moral oppositions (such as the four-corner opposition) can give the audience the impression of moral complexity that is the hallmark of real life.

You will notice that these three techniques allow you not to impose the theme on the characters but rather to express it through the characters. This ensures the story does not come across as preachy. You will also notice that the story has more depth because the opposition between the characters is not solely based on the plot, not limited to a competition for the same goal. Entire ways of life are at stake. The emotional impact on the audience is therefore enormous.

THE THEME VIA STRUCTURE

The moral debate does not mean that your hero and their adversary engage in a verbal debate about morality from the first scene. The moral debate is a debate of actions that must be created by showing the hero and the adversary using certain means to achieve an end. This is how you weave the theme into the story's structure rather than imposing it on the audience in an unsubtle way through dialogue.

Moreover, here is a major principle of storytelling: structure is not just a vehicle for content; it is content. And this content is much more powerful than what your characters say. And this principle applies nowhere as precisely as in the theme.

In a good story, the narrative structure converges towards the end, while the theme grows in the audience's mind. The question is: how can a convergent narrative structure cause the theme to amplify? One could schematize structure and theme when they ideally align as follows:

At the beginning of the story, you put the hero and their adversary in opposition. But the resulting conflict is not intense, and the audience does not yet know how each other's values conflict. They therefore have almost no idea of the story's theme.

Towards the middle of the narrative, the conflict between the hero and their adversary intensifies, hence the convergent structure. In this conflict, the opposition of values gradually becomes apparent. Consequently, the theme begins to amplify. However, for most of a good story, the theme remains largely hidden; it develops slowly in the audience's mind, and it is not until the end of the story that it strikes them with all its force.

The point of convergence of the narrative structure is the confrontation, which is immediately followed by the awakening and the moral decision. During the confrontation, the audience sees not just which force, but also which set of values prevails over the other. The audience's understanding of the theme then quickly amplifies. During the awakening—especially if it is a moral awakening—the theme amplifies even more. And this growing movement reaches its peak with the moral decision. Since the theme has been expressed through the structure, readers or viewers feel it emerges from the depths of their soul, rather than being imposed on them like a tedious sermon.

We will now examine in detail how the moral debate is expressed through the structure from the beginning to the end of the story. We will start with the basic strategy of expressing the moral debate, then we will study some variations.

Moral Debate: Basic Strategy

• Values The hero begins the story with a set of values and beliefs.

• Moral Weakness At the beginning of the story, the hero harms others in some way. They are not an evil being; they act out of weakness or ignorance of how to behave with others.

• Moral Need The hero must overcome their moral weakness and learn to behave correctly with others to evolve and live better.

• First Immoral Action The hero almost immediately commits an action that hurts others. The audience then understands that they possess a basic moral imperfection.

• Desire The hero sets a goal for which they are willing to sacrifice everything. This goal pushes them into direct conflict with an adversary who has different values but the same goal.

• Narrative Dynamism The hero and their adversary undertake a series of actions to achieve their goal.

• Immoral Actions Towards the beginning and middle of the story, the hero is generally dominated by their adversary. Desperate, they begin to commit immoral actions to prevail.

Criticism: Other characters criticize the hero for the means they use.

Justification: The hero tries to justify their actions. They may discover the truth about their situation and the harm they have done at the end of the story, but not now.

• Attack by an Ally The hero's best friend strongly reproaches them for their methods.

• Obsessive Dynamic Galvanized by new revelations about how to prevail, the hero becomes completely obsessed with the goal and seems almost ready for anything.

• Immoral Actions The hero's immoral actions intensify.

Criticism: Other characters also intensify their criticisms.

Justification: The hero vehemently defends their actions.

As the story progresses, the different values and ways of life represented by the hero and their adversary become clearer through action and dialogue. There are four moments at the end of the story when the theme explodes in the audience's mind. These moments are the confrontation, the awakening, the moral decision, and a structural stage we have not yet discussed: the thematic revelation.

• Confrontation This is the final conflict that determines who will achieve the goal. Regardless of the winner's identity, the audience learns which values and ideas are superior to others.

• Final Action Against the Adversary The hero may commit one last action—moral or immoral—against the adversary just before or during the confrontation.

• Moral Awakening The ordeal of the confrontation brings about an awakening in the hero who understands they were wrong about themselves, others, and how they must now act towards others. The audience identifying with the character, the awakening gives the theme all the force it deserves.

• Moral Decision The hero chooses between two ways of acting. This choice is proof of their moral awakening.

• Thematic Revelation In great stories, the theme reaches the peak of its impact on the audience at the moment of thematic revelation. The thematic revelation is not limited to the hero. It rather touches the audience who thus intuits how they should act and live in the world. This intuition goes beyond the characters' limits and affects the audience in their own lives. With the thematic revelation, the audience sees the "complete design" of the story, all the ramifications of its meaning, on a larger scale, no longer limited to the characters.

You understand that it is important to find a balance in terms of power between the hero and their main adversary not only for the network of characters and the plot but also for the moral debate. If the hero is too strong or too kind, the adversary will not be able to test them and make them commit moral errors. If the hero is too simple and naive, the adversary will be like a spider weaving a web from which the hero cannot even imagine escaping. The hero will become a victim, and the adversary will appear as an evil being.

Portrait of a Lady, by Henry James, is a masterpiece in many respects, but this novel suffers from an imbalance in terms of power, and the moral debate suffers. Isabel Archer lives in illusion throughout the story, even when she makes her final moral decision, that of helping Pansy, who cannot be helped. This sweet but naive woman must face the born schemer Osmond, a being whose talent for devising traps is matched only by his determination and the sadistic pleasure he takes in it.

TECHNIQUE: MORAL DEBATE = PLOT

The first thing that can make a story moralizing is an imbalance between moral debate and plot. You can express the moral debate through the narrative structure, organize it perfectly, and highlight it with subtle moral dialogues, but if your plot is not rich enough to support it, it will necessarily sink into the most boring sermonizing.

The plot, as we will see in Chapter 8, is a complex choreography that intertwines the actions of the hero and their adversaries in a way that surprises the audience. And it is this element of surprise, of magic, that prevents the moral line from sinking and gives it punch.

Let's take the example of The Verdict to illustrate the basic strategy of the moral debate in a story.

THE VERDICT

(novel by Barry C. Reed, 1980; screenplay by David Mamet, 1982)
• Beliefs and values of the hero At the beginning, Frank values alcohol, money, and opportunism.

• Moral weakness Addicted to alcohol and lacking self-respect or future plans, Frank would do anything for money.

• Moral need To act justly towards others rather than using them to make money.

• First immoral action To drum up business, Frank crashes a funeral pretending to be a friend of the deceased.

• Desire To win the trial and secure the damages his clients need to start over.

• Narrative drive Frank takes several actions to get an expert doctor to testify for his clients and to find the nurse who was in the operating room.

• Immoral action Frank reassures the victim's sister, Sally, while negotiating a settlement between two hundred and two hundred fifty thousand dollars, allowing him to pocket a third without having to go to trial.

Critique: None.

Justification: Frank is an alcoholic who has lost all self-esteem along with a sense of justice and morality. He thinks: why risk a trial rather than the financial certainty of a settlement?

• Moral awakening Early in the story, Frank sees his client, the victim, in a vegetative state, and realizes he must act justly if he doesn't want to lose himself forever.

• Moral decision Frank risks losing his share of the money by refusing the settlement and insisting on going to trial to ensure justice is served.

• Thematic revelation It is only by acting justly that one can save one's life.

• Attack by an ally The main attack comes not from Mickey, Frank's fellow lawyer, but from his clients. When they learn he refused the settlement without consulting them, they accuse him of incompetence and prostitution.

Justification: Frank tells them he will earn them much more by pleading their case than by accepting the settlement offer. But while he argues money, the real reason he refused the settlement was his desire for justice.

• Obsessive drive He is determined to find the nurse who was in the operating room.

• Immoral action Through cunning, Frank gets a woman to talk about the nurse and learns she will not testify for the opposing side.

Critique: None.

Justification: Frank believes he must find the nurse if he wants to win the trial.

• Immoral action Frank breaks into the woman's mailbox to find the nurse's phone number.

Critique: None. Frank acts in secret.

Justification: This is Frank's last chance to defend a just cause.

• Immoral action Frank hits his girlfriend, Laura, when he discovers she was paid by the opposing side to reveal information about his case.

Critique: Laura does not criticize because she feels guilty herself.

Justification: Frank, who loves this woman, felt utterly betrayed.

• Confrontation Frank questions Dr. Towler about the time the patient ate. The nurse, Kaitlin, states that the victim ate not at 9 o'clock but an hour after admission. She explains that Dr. Towler did not read the admission form and asked her to change the 1 to a 9 if she didn't want to be fired. Master Cancannon, the opposing lawyer, reads a precedent regarding the inadmissibility of a copy as evidence. The judge agrees and dismisses the nurse's entire testimony.

• Final action against the adversary Frank commits no immoral action during the trial. He simply pleads with conviction and intelligence.

The Verdict is a perfect example of how to use moral debate in a story, but this example presents a notable exception, a very instructive exception. The hero has a powerful moral awakening when he realizes what his client has suffered: she is in a coma due to the fault of two doctors, and he had intended to abandon her for the lure of profit. He makes his moral decision when he refuses the settlement to champion justice in court, even if it doesn't earn him a penny.

However, the awakening and decision occur barely twenty-five minutes into the film. This tends to diminish the power of the moral debate because, from that point, the moral danger the hero was in is averted. The audience still enjoys the suspense of wondering whether the hero will win the trial. For Frank remains an insecure and alcoholic lawyer. But they know Frank has learned to act justly, and that is now what he does.

The moral debate is more powerful when it is more dramatic. This means, among other things, delaying the awakening and moral decision as long as possible in the story, as close to the end as possible. Make sure readers or viewers keep in the back of their minds as long as possible this little question: "Will the hero do what is necessary, and will he do it in time?"

THE ILIAD

(Homer)

The moral debate of The Iliad is based on the basic strategy of the hero's slow decline and then his rise at the moment of awakening. But The Iliad offers an important variation by repeating this sequence twice.

The first sequence of decline and rise occurs over the first three-quarters of the narrative. The hero, Achilles, begins the story in a state of entirely justified anger against his main adversary, Agamemnon, who has taken the woman rightfully his. But his excessive pride (his moral weakness) leads him to act immorally, overreacting by refusing to fight, which results in the deaths of many of his comrades.

Until the middle of the story, Achilles' anger, which is very selfish, seems increasingly unjustified. But when his friend Patroclus dies, Achilles realizes his mistake, reconciles with Agamemnon, and returns to battle. This is the first awakening and moral decision.

The moral debate repeats itself more intensely but more concisely in the last quarter of the story: Achilles' anger against his second adversary, Hector, is initially justified, but Achilles declines morally when this anger leads him to desecrate Hector's corpse by dragging it behind his chariot around Troy. Hector's father, Priam, begs for his son's body to be returned. Achilles then has a second, even deeper awakening, realizing the superiority of compassion over vengeance, and decides to let Priam take back his son's body for a proper burial.

VARIANTS OF THE MORAL DEBATE

The basic method has several variants. You may feel the need to use multiple types of moral debates in your story, but as we will see later, combining forms is a risky endeavor.

1. Good versus Evil

In this minor variant of the moral debate, the hero remains good and his adversary bad throughout the story. This approach is particularly common in myths, action stories, and melodramas, which are simple moral tales with easily identifiable characters. The moral sequence unfolds as follows:

• The hero has a psychological weakness but is fundamentally good.

• His adversary is morally corrupt and may even be evil (intrinsically immoral).

• During the competition for the goal, the hero makes mistakes but never acts immorally.

• The adversary, on the other hand, performs many immoral actions.

• The hero wins the goal simply because he is good. When the two sides of the moral angle meet, it is the good hero who wins the "game" of life.

Examples of this type of moral debate can be found in The Matrix; City Slickers; Field of Dreams; Crocodile Dundee; Dances with Wolves; The Blues Brothers; Star Wars; Forrest Gump; Stagecoach; Places in the Heart; Terminator; The Fugitive; The Last of the Mohicans; Shane; and The Wizard of Oz.

2. Tragedy

Tragedy follows the basic method but alters its final part: at the beginning of the story, the hero is given a fatal flaw, and an awakening comes too late, near the end. The sequence works as follows:

• The community is in crisis.

• The hero has great potential but also a great flaw.

• The hero enters into conflict with a powerful or skilled adversary.

• The hero is obsessed with the goal and performs several questionable or immoral actions to achieve it.

• The conflict and competition bring out the hero's flaw, which worsens.

• The hero has an awakening, but it comes too late to prevent his downfall.

The key to this strategy is to emphasize the awareness of what could have been, on wasted potential, while showing that the hero's actions are his responsibility. The wasted potential is the key element to gaining the audience's sympathy while avoiding making him a victim, as his fatal flaw makes the hero responsible. The audience is saddened by the waste made even more tragic by the fact that the hero has his awakening... just a little too late to save him. But even if the hero dies or falls, the audience remains deeply moved by his emotional and moral success.

You will notice that this strategy marks a significant shift from classical Greek drama: the hero's fall is not the inevitable result of the action of immense and impersonal forces; it is the consequence of the hero's own choices.

Here are some examples of classic tragedies: Hamlet, King Lear, Seven Samurai, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Nixon, The Thomas Crown Affair, The Age of Innocence, Wuthering Heights, Vertigo, Amadeus, Le Morte d'Arthur, American Beauty, Touch of Evil, and Citizen Kane.

WUTHERING HEIGHTS

(novel by Emily Brontë, 1847, screenplay by Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht, 1939)

Wuthering Heights is a love story written as a classic tragedy. The moral debate follows several threads: the destructive actions of the two main characters. And since this debate is based on the tragedy strategy, these characters are devastated by a terrible sense of responsibility, feeling guilty for what they have done to each other.

Cathy, the heroine, is not an unloved girl manipulated by a man. She is a woman who loves deeply, a love that "can only be found in heaven," but she deliberately abandons it for a man who will bring her wealth and comfort. Initially, she is in love with Heathcliff, and this love is mutual, but she refuses to live with a man who looks like a poor beggar. She wants to "dance and sing in the beautiful world."

When she returns from her stay at Edgar Linton's home, Heathcliff, her main adversary, criticizes her for staying so long. She defends herself by saying she had a lot of fun there. Then she hurts Heathcliff by ordering him to take a bath so he won't embarrass her in front of her guest (Edgar).

But Cathy immediately recovers from her moral fall when Edgar asks how she can bear to live under the same roof as Heathcliff. Furious, she replies that Heathcliff was her friend long before him and that if he wants to speak ill of him, he should leave. Edgar leaves, and Cathy tears her pretty clothes, runs to join Heathcliff on the rock where he waits, and asks for his forgiveness.

The moral debate crafted by Brontë through Cathy reaches its peak when the young girl explains to her servant that she plans to marry Edgar while Heathcliff listens secretly in the next room. It is then Nellie, the ally, who will lead the critique. She asks Cathy why she loves Edgar. Cathy replies that it's because he is handsome and pleasant and will one day be rich. Then, when Nellie asks about Heathcliff, Cathy says it would be degrading to marry him.

The powerful moral debate crafted by Brontë is supported by dialogues perfectly in harmony with the rhythm of a brilliant and highly emotional plot. Devastated, Heathcliff leaves, but only Nellie can see him. Shortly after, Cathy changes her mind and says she is not in love with Edgar. She dreams of being cast out of heaven and finding herself on the moor, and she sobs with joy. She says she only thinks of Heathcliff, but he seems to take pleasure in being cruel to her. Yet Heathcliff is much closer to her than she thinks. Cathy and Heathcliff are soulmates. After a heartbreaking awakening, Cathy says: "I am Heathcliff." When she discovers that Heathcliff heard her when she said it would be degrading to marry him, she runs out and cries her love in the storm. But it is too late.

This is the moment Brontë chose to radically alter the course of the tragic moral debate by literally reversing the roles and giving the lead to Heathcliff. Thus, Heathcliff, the new hero, returns and attacks cruelly as a love found in heaven must when it is scorned for something so grossly earthly.

Heathcliff is a rebel who, like Achilles, initially has a desire for revenge that seems justified. Brontë uses the "return of the man" technique: she brings back a rich and sophisticated Heathcliff, reminiscent of the Count of Monte Cristo. Readers or viewers are then overwhelmed by a sense of triumph, so much so that they don't even need to understand how the character could have undergone such a transformation. The man is back, finally armed with the weapons everyone would dream of having in such a situation. The reader or viewer thinks: "It's possible – I could have done it." then "And there, I would have taken my revenge."

With the audience clearly on Heathcliff's side, Brontë reverses the moral debate by pushing her hero too far. For even losing such a great love in such an unjust way does not justify marrying the sister and sister-in-law of his enemies out of pure revenge. Observing the innocent love that lights up Isabella's face, Edgar's sister, as she walks into the trap set by Heathcliff, is heartbreaking. It is a perfect illustration of the effect a good moral debate should produce.

These scenes between Cathy and Heathcliff are ordinary versions of those of kings and queens at war. It is Lear raging on the moor. If the concept of heavenly love is particularly credible, it is thanks to the ferocity of the attacks the two protagonists launch at each other. It is pure savagery that can only be explained by the extreme love they have for each other.

At the end of the film adaptation, Heathcliff attacks Cathy one last time, and it is a justified attack, even though Cathy is on her deathbed. He does not seek to comfort her. She is afflicted by his tears. She begs him not to break her heart. But he replies that she broke it herself: "What right did you have to sacrifice love for that poor something, that whim you felt for him?" Nothing in the world could have separated them. But she did it herself, he explains, by indulging in debauchery like a greedy child. Cathy begs for his forgiveness, and they kiss.

In the novel, Heathcliff goes too far, this time well beyond the bounds, by trying to destroy the Linton dynasty. That is why this section was cut from the film adaptation, which is a far superior work to the novel in terms of storytelling. In the novel, from this attack, the organic story of Cathy and Heathcliff is fundamentally over, Heathcliff only adds to the revenge and Brontë to the moral debate, just because she excels at it.

KING LEAR

(William Shakespeare, 1605)

In King Lear, Shakespeare crafts a more nuanced moral debate than those typically found in classic tragedies. The key to this technique is creating two "heroes": Lear, the main character, and Gloucester, the secondary character. Both Lear and Gloucester begin the play with moral flaws, then decline throughout the story, have a moral awakening, and eventually die. But their deaths lack the noble character of, for example, Hamlet's. The audience does not feel that the world's order has been restored, that all will be well in the kingdom of Denmark.

Shakespeare preferred to shift the focus to the elemental immorality of man and the amorality of nature. First, his two heroes, Lear and Gloucester, make the same moral mistake and die cruelly. A king experiencing a tragic fall gives pause. Two kings experiencing a tragic fall is proof of a moral blindness that seems endemic to the human race.

Then, Shakespeare has Cordelia, the only morally good character in the play, killed in a particularly cruel manner. It is true that Edgar, a good but primarily foolish man, has defeated his wicked brother and the two pests, Lear's daughters. But in this overwhelming devastation, there is little left to find value in a life turned toward good. In the famous last line of the play, Edgar says: "We that are young shall never see so much, nor live so long." In other words, in a world populated by immoral beings, despite immense suffering, a man can live intensely, but at what cost! For an aging Shakespeare, this is all the nobility one can expect from the human race.

3. Pathos

Pathos is a moral debate that reduces the tragic hero to an ordinary man and touches the audience by presenting the beauty of perseverance, lost causes, and the inevitability of failure. The main character has no awakening, not even too late. He is incapable of having one. But he never stops fighting, he struggles to the end. This moral debate can be outlined as follows:

• The hero has a set of outdated or rigid beliefs and values.

• The hero has a moral need; he is not a victim.

• The goal he sets is out of reach, but he doesn't know it.

• His adversary is far too powerful for him. It may be a system or a set of forces the hero cannot understand. This adversary is not evil. It is simply impersonal or indifferent and very powerful.

• The hero undertakes a series of immoral actions to win and refuses to listen to the warnings and criticisms of his allies.

• The hero does not achieve the goal. The adversary wins an overwhelming victory, but the audience understands it was not an equal confrontation.

• The hero ends up desperate: he is a broken man with no awakening and dies of grief, or – this is what the moral decision is reduced to – decides to commit suicide.

• The audience feels a deep sense of injustice and sadness at the death of this little man who has no idea what destroyed him. But they admire the beauty of the confrontation and failure and the hero's refusal to admit defeat.

The moral debate of pathos can be found in Don Quixote; A Streetcar Named Desire; many Japanese films such as Ikiru; Death of a Salesman; Hedda Gabler; The Conversation; McCabe & Mrs. Miller; Falling Down; M; The Apu Trilogy; Madame Bovary; The Magnificent Ambersons; The Cherry Orchard; Dog Day Afternoon; and Cinema Paradiso.

4. Satire and Irony

Satire and irony are two different things but often go hand in hand. Satire is a comedy that mocks beliefs, particularly those on which a society is based. Irony is a form of narrative logic where a character gets the opposite of what they sought to obtain. When used for the entire story, irony becomes a framework that connects all the actions of the story and expresses a philosophical view of how the world works. Irony also creates a perplexed tone that encourages the audience to laugh at the relative incompetence of the characters.

With the ironic-satirical form, the moral debate is crafted by creating a constant contrast between a character who thinks he is a moral man – by supporting the beliefs of his society – and the consequences of his beliefs and actions, which are invariably immoral. The main steps of the ironic-satirical debate are as follows:

• The hero lives in a clearly defined social system. Very often, a character partially or completely explains the values on which the system is based.

• The hero firmly believes in this system and is determined to climb its ranks. He sets a goal related to ambition or love.

• An adversary, who also firmly believes in this system and its values, seeks to achieve the same goal.

• As the characters fight for the goal, their beliefs lead them to undertake stupid and destructive actions.

• The debate of actions, in the middle of the story, builds on a series of juxtapositions that highlight the contradiction between characters who claim to act morally by expressing the highest ideals of society, and the disastrous consequences of their actions.

• The confrontation brings out the pride and hypocrisy of both parties.

• The hero has an awakening that usually leads him to question the value of his belief system.

• Often, the hero, or a secondary character, undermines the awakening, proving it has not been fully assimilated.

• The hero undertakes a moral action that is good in itself but generally has no impact on the stupidity or destructiveness of the system.

• A new friendship or love is formed, suggesting the couple will form a better microcosm but will have little effect on society as a whole.
The ironic-satirical debate is used in Pride and Prejudice; Emma (and its modern version, Clueless); American Beauty; Wedding Crashers; Madame Bovary; The Cherry Orchard; The Graduate; M*A*S*H; The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling; Waiting for Guffman; The Player; Being John Malkovich; Down and Out in Beverly Hills; The Prince and the Pauper (and its modern version, Trading Places); La Cage aux Folles; The Importance of Being Earnest; Private Benjamin; Dog Day Afternoon; Victor Victoria; Shampoo; Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice; and Lost in America.

EMMA

(Jane Austen, 1816)

Jane Austen's works are models of ironic-satirical moral debate, and Emma is probably her greatest achievement. Here is the moral sequence of this classic satire:

• Emma is a stubborn, insensitive, and self-satisfied young woman who constantly seeks to play matchmaker.

• Her first goal is to marry off Harriet, an orphan.

• Firmly believing in the class system but mistakenly thinking Harriet comes from a more affluent background than she appears, Emma convinces her to refuse the marriage proposal of the farmer Robert Martin.

• She also convinces Harriet to try to marry the vicar, Mr. Elton, whose social status is more advantageous. But in this process, Emma inadvertently leads Mr. Elton to think that she herself is attracted to him.

• The result of these well-intentioned but immoral actions is that Harriet has refused the proposal of a good man and Mr. Elton declares his love for Emma, only to have his heart broken when he discovers she is not in love with him after all.

• At a ball, Mr. Elton, who has just married another woman, embarrasses Harriet by refusing her a dance. But Harriet is saved by Mr. Knightley, who invites her to take a turn on the floor.

• Frank, a man passing through the county, saves Harriet when confronted by unpleasant characters on the road. Emma mistakenly thinks Frank is Harriet's new suitor, although he is of a higher class than she is.

• During a picnic, Emma flirts with Frank, though she is not attracted to him. This visibly angers another character in the social group, the pretty Jane.

• Emma also publicly humiliates the talkative but kind Miss Bates. Mr. Knightley takes Emma aside and reproaches her for her insensitivity.

• When she learns that it is Mr. Knightley, not Frank, whom Harriet has set her sights on, Emma is shocked: she realizes she herself is in love with Mr. Knightley. Moreover, she becomes aware that she has been arrogant and naive in meddling in matters that do not concern her and bitterly regrets having prevented Harriet from marrying Robert Martin.

• Mr. Knightley declares his love for Emma and agrees to move in with her so she can continue to care for her father. In the novel, but not in the film, the typical comedy-ending marriage and Emma's great realization are shaken by a paradox: if Emma is able to marry Mr. Knightley, it is only because her father fears chicken thieves and wants a young man in the house.

In this story, the main ironic-satirical debate is carried by Emma's efforts to find a good match for Harriet. Through this means, Austen exposes a system based on class differences and women's extreme dependence on men. Her heroine, Emma, supports this system but lacks intelligence and discernment. With great subtlety, Austen goes further in questioning the system by making the farmer, whom Emma believes to be of a lower social class than Harriet, a good and estimable man.

The moral debate progresses through a series of negative consequences generated by the ideas and actions of the matchmaking heroine. Austen reinforces the debate with two scenes of social humiliation and immorality that form a parallel. The first is where Harriet is embarrassed by Mr. Elton, who refuses to dance with her, before Mr. Knightley comes to her rescue. The second is where Emma cruelly snubs Miss Bates during a picnic. Again, Mr. Knightley plays the role of moral corrector by reproaching Emma for her insensitivity.

It should be noted that Austen, in these decisive scenes, argues for a deeper morality based not on social status but on what is good and proper in the relationship of one human being to another. It should also be noted that Austen avoids a moralizing tone by giving these scenes a strong emotional charge. The audience is pained to see Harriet snubbed and Miss Bates publicly humiliated. And they are pleased when Mr. Knightley does the right thing: saving a defenseless young woman or reminding our heroine when she is being cruel.

Emma and Mr. Knightley's marriage is a reaffirmation of the system insofar as both characters have a fairly high and relatively similar social status. This system, and the values on which it is based, will not change at the end of the satire. But the union of the two protagonists subtly shakes it. Emma and Mr. Knightley come together not because they are of the right social class but because Emma has evolved and become better, and because Mr. Knightley is a moral man, regardless of social status.

5. Black Comedy

Black comedy plays on the logical—or more precisely illogical—nature of a system. This elaborate form of storytelling is designed to demonstrate that annihilation is not so much the result of an individual choice (as in tragedy) but of a fundamentally destructive system that traps individuals. The key to the moral debate is to prevent the hero from having an awareness, so as to give it even more impact to the audience. The moral debate in black comedy unfolds as follows:

• Many characters coexist in an organization. Someone explains in great detail the rules of the system and its logic.

• Many characters, including the hero, seek to achieve the same goal, which generally involves killing someone or destroying something.

• All firmly believe in this goal and think that what they are doing is perfectly sensible. In reality, their actions are completely illogical.

• The opponents, who are also part of the system, also seek to achieve the goal and justify themselves with precise arguments.

• A wise character, usually the ally, constantly demonstrates that the characters' actions make no sense and will inevitably lead to disaster. He plays the role of the chorus, but no one listens to him.

• All characters, including the hero, use extreme, even criminal, means to achieve the goal.

• The characters' actions lead to death and destruction.

• The confrontation is intense and destructive, with each character still thinking they are right. Most characters die or go mad.

• No character, not even the hero, has an awareness. But it is so obvious that the hero should have had this awareness that the audience has it instead.

• The characters who are not dead are horribly mutilated but immediately resume their efforts to achieve the goal.

• At the end of the most positive black comedies, the wise character contemplates the system with horror and may even leave it or try to change it.

This form is extremely delicate to achieve. For the moral debate of black comedy to work, the hero must first be made sympathetic. If not, the comedy becomes an abstraction, an intellectual essay, with the audience able to distance themselves from the characters and feel morally superior to them. The readers or viewers must be absorbed by the story so that they can suddenly discover that they are fundamentally these characters and not beings superior to them.

Apart from creating a sympathetic hero, the best way to emotionally engage the audience in a black comedy is to have the hero passionately explain the logic of their goal. Authors who wish to add a touch of hope to this pessimistic form can offer the only sane character an alternative to this madness, as long as it is detailed.

Among the stories that use the black comedy debate are Goodfellas, Network, Wag the Dog, After Hours, Dr. Strangelove, Catch-22, Heathers, Brazil, and Prizzi's Honor.

COMBINING DIFFERENT TYPES OF MORAL DEBATES

Although they are self-sufficient forms, different types of moral debates are not necessarily exclusive of each other. In fact, some high-level authors use an excellent technique of combining different types of moral debates in a single story. Joyce's Ulysses begins with the very simple good/evil debate found in most myths and deepens it with a much more complex ironic-satirical approach. The Cherry Orchard is a combination of pathos and ironic-satirical debate.

In its attempt to mix tragedy, black comedy, and ironic satire, American Beauty shows us how difficult it is to combine these forms. Although brilliant in many respects, the story never fully achieves its potential as a tragedy, black comedy, or satire. If the different forms of moral debates are self-sufficient, it is for a specific reason: they work in very different ways and have a very different emotional impact on the audience. To assemble them naturally requires total technical mastery.

Other examples of combined moral debates can be found in Madame Bovary, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and Dog Day Afternoon.

THE UNIQUE MORAL VIEWPOINT

At the most advanced stage of moral debate in storytelling is the author capable of creating a unique moral viewpoint, in the sense of singular. In The Scarlet Letter, for example, Nathaniel Hawthorne develops a triangular opposition between characters that tends to defend a natural morality based on true love. With Ulysses, James Joyce created a natural religion and everyday heroism by sending a "father" and a "son" on a one-day journey through Dublin. These are large-scale moral debates, but they are not only moral debates. The expertise and artistry of these writers are also reflected in their networks of characters, their plots, the universe of their stories, and their symbols, which are as vast and precise as their moral debates.

A unique moral viewpoint is also found in some blockbusters. If you think it is the special effects that made these films big successes, you are mistaken. In Star Wars, George Lucas made a modern amalgam of Western and Eastern morality by combining a Western hero, a sort of Zen knightly order, and a morality called "the Force." The moral debate is, of course, much less elaborate than in The Scarlet Letter or Ulysses. But the intention is there, and in its conciseness, it contributed to the universal success of the films in this saga.

Similarly, The Godfather does not just portray the Mafia world in 1940s America. This film also presents a moral system based on the modern economy and a new form of warfare. The lines "I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse," "It's just business, it's nothing personal," and "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer" constitute the catechism of a modern American version of Machiavelli's The Prince. Like Star Wars, The Godfather treats morality succinctly. But note that the attempt to present a moral system is one of the major causes of the success of these stories when it is successful.

THE MORAL DEBATE IN DIALOGUE

It is primarily through narrative structure that a moral debate is constructed in a story. But it is not the only way. Dialogue must also be used. When structure is left to do most of the work, it allows dialogue to do what it does best, namely providing subtlety and emotional power.

We will explain in detail how to write moral dialogue in Chapter 10, "Building Scenes and Symphonic Dialogues." For now, let's look at the best places to insert this type of dialogue in the story.

Very often, the moral debate is expressed in the dialogues of the scene where an ally reproaches the hero for having undertaken immoral actions to achieve their goal. The ally explains to the hero that they are wrong. The hero, who has not yet had an awareness, defends their actions.

To highlight the moral debate through dialogues, one can also rely on the conflict between the hero and the adversary, at any point in the story, although it is easier to do so during a confrontation scene. A typical example of a moral debate occurring during a confrontation is found in the scene from The Hustler that opposes Eddie Felson to his former manager, Bert. In It's a Wonderful Life, the moral debate between the hero and the adversary occurs earlier in the story when George prevents Potter from taking over the family building and loan business. The great advantage of an early moral debate between the hero and their adversary is that it indicates to the audience what values are truly at stake and allows the drama to develop.

Finally, one can insert moral dialogue in a scene where the main adversary justifies their actions from a moral standpoint, even though they are wrong. This type of scene is the hallmark of very good authors because the adversary's moral arguments play a crucial role in the overall moral debate of the story.

An evil adversary is a character who is fundamentally bad, and therefore mechanical and uninteresting. In most real-life conflicts, good and evil, right and wrong, are not clearly defined. In good stories, both the hero and the adversary believe they are right and have reasons to believe so. They are also both wrong, although not in the same way.

By giving your adversary strong (though erroneous) arguments, you avoid the simplistic pattern of the good hero versus the bad adversary and give depth to this character. And since a hero is only as good as the character they fight against is interesting, you also give depth to your hero.

An excellent example of a moral debate with the adversary is found in The Verdict when attorney Concannon, the opposing lawyer, tells the woman he hired to spy on Frank: "We're paid to win." In A Few Good Men, Colonel Jessep justifies ordering the murder of a marine by presenting himself as the last bastion of a territory surrounded by barbarians. In Shadow of a Doubt, brilliantly written by Thornton Wilder, Uncle Charlie, a serial killer, terrifyingly justifies murdering widows by presenting them as large animals that "drink money, eat money... And what do you do to animals when they become too fat or too old?"

The key to success is not to make the adversary a "straw man," a character who seems formidable at first glance but is actually hollow. Never give your adversary obviously weak arguments. Give them the best arguments you can find. Give them reason on certain points. But also ensure there is a fatal flaw in their logic.

DEFINING THE MORAL DEBATE – WRITING EXERCISE NO. 4

• Guiding Principle Start by turning the guiding principle of your story into a thematic line. This thematic line should correspond to your viewpoint on what constitutes good and bad actions in this story summarized in a single sentence. When working on the guiding principle, focus on the key actions and their moral consequences.

• Techniques for Thematic Line Think of all the techniques, such as symbols, capable of condensing your moral viewpoint into a sentence or summarizing the unique structure you will give to your story.

• Moral Choice Write the determining moral choice your hero will have to make towards the end of the story.

• Moral Problem Revisit your work on the premise and formulate in a single sentence the central moral problem your hero will face throughout the story.

• Characters Seen as Variations on the Same Theme Starting with the hero and the main adversary, explain how each character confronts the central moral problem differently.

• Conflicting Values List the key values of each of the main characters and explain how these values will come into conflict as each character seeks to achieve the goal.

MORAL DEBATE

Detail the moral debate you will develop through the story's structure using the following sequence:

• Beliefs and Values of the Hero Reformulate the essential beliefs and values of your hero.

• Moral Weakness What is the main weakness of your hero in their behavior with others?

• Moral Need Towards the end of the story, what must your hero learn about the right way to behave and live in the world?

• First Immoral Action Describe the first action of your hero that will hurt another character in the story. Ensure this action stems from the hero's major moral weakness.

• Desire Reformulate the precise goal of your hero.

• Narrative Drive List all the actions your hero will undertake to achieve their goal.

• Immoral Actions When these actions are immoral, why are they so?

Critique: Write the critique or critiques the hero will receive after one or more of their immoral actions.

Justification: How does the hero justify each of their immoral actions?

• Attack by an Ally Explain precisely the main moral attack led by the ally against the hero. Again, write the hero's justification.

• Obsessive Dynamic Explain when and how your hero becomes completely obsessed with victory. In other words, at what point does your hero decide they are willing to do almost anything to win?

• Immoral Actions While obsessed with victory, what immoral actions does your hero undertake?

Critique: Describe the critique your hero will eventually face following these actions.

Justification: Explain how your hero justifies their methods.

• Confrontation During the final confrontation, how will you show that one set of values—those of the hero or the adversary—is superior to the other in this case?

• Final Action Against the Adversary Before or during the confrontation, will your hero undertake a final action—moral or not—against the adversary?

• Moral Awareness What will your hero have learned, or failed to learn, by the end of the story? Ensure the answer to this question relates to how to behave with others.

• Moral Decision Towards the end of the story, must your hero choose between two ways of acting?

• Thematic Revelation Try to find a narrative event other than the hero's awareness through which you will express your vision of how people should change in their behavior.

Let's take the example of the film Casablanca to better understand how the moral debate works.

CASABLANCA

(play, Everybody Comes to Rick’s, by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, screenplay by Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein, and Howard Koch, 1942)

• Guiding Principle A marginalized former freedom fighter reunites with a lost love but chooses to resume the fight when that love returns to him.

• Thematic Line Even the greatest love must be sacrificed in the fight against oppression.

• Moral Choice Rick must choose between staying with the woman he loves and fighting dictatorship in the world.

• Moral Problem What balance to find between personal desires and sacrifice for the good of society as a whole?

• Characters Seen as Variations on the Same Theme

Rick: For most of the story, Rick only cares about himself, uninterested in the world's problems.

Ilsa: Ilsa tries to do the right thing but ultimately, love is too strong for her.

Laszlo: Laszlo is willing to sacrifice anything, including his love, to fight against fascism.

Renault: Renault is a true opportunist who only cares about himself and money.

• Conflicting Values

Rick: Self, honesty, his friends.

Ilsa: Loyalty to her husband, love for Rick, fight against the Nazis.

Laszlo: Fight against the Nazis, love for Ilsa, love for humanity.

Renault: Women, money, power.

MORAL DEBATE

• Beliefs and Values of the Hero Self, honesty, his friends.

Critique: A man tells Rick he hopes he won't be around if the Germans come for him.

Justification: Rick replies that he sticks his neck out for nobody.

• Desire Rick wants Ilsa.

• Narrative Drive Rick often attacks Ilsa while trying to win her back. He also undertakes several actions to keep the transit letters to sell or use them for himself.

• Immoral Action When Ilsa returns after the club closes, Rick refuses to listen to her and calls her a tramp.

Critique: Ilsa doesn't verbally criticize but gives Rick a cold look as he leaves.

Justification: Rick doesn't seek to justify himself.

• Attack by an Ally Throughout the story, it's Rick's main adversary, Ilsa, who reproaches him the most. However, Rick's friend, Sam, the bartender, keeps advising him to stop clinging to his lost love. And Rick replies: "If she can take it, I can take it. Play it, Sam [our song]."

• Immoral Action In the market, Rick makes advances to Ilsa and asks her to lie to Laszlo and come back to him.
Critique: Ilsa reproaches Rick for no longer being the man she knew in Paris and tells him she was married to Laszlo before meeting him.

Justification: Rick does not try to justify his words and simply says he was drunk the night before.

• Obsessive dynamic Initially, Rick seeks to hurt Ilsa to avenge the pain she caused him. It is only later in the story that he becomes obsessed with the idea of helping Ilsa and Laszlo escape.

• Immoral action Rick rejects Laszlo's proposal regarding the letters and tells him to ask Ilsa for explanations.

Critique: None.

Justification: Rick wants to hurt Ilsa.

• Immoral action Rick refuses to give the letters to Ilsa.

Critique: Ilsa explains to him that this cause is more important than personal feelings and that it is also her fight. If Rick does not give her the letters, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

• Justification: Rick explains that he now only cares about himself.

• Immoral action Rick tells Ilsa that he will only help Laszlo escape. His last lie to Ilsa—making her believe they will leave together—is actually the starting point of a noble action, namely saving Laszlo and Ilsa.

Critique: Renault says he would do the same in Rick's place, which, given the character's nature, is not a compliment.

Justification: Rick does not seek to justify himself. He must deceive Renault into believing he plans to leave with Ilsa.

• Confrontation Rick asks Renault to call the airport, but Renault calls Major Strasser. At the airport, Rick points a gun at Renault and tells Ilsa to leave with Laszlo. Rick tells Laszlo that Ilsa has been faithful to him. Laszlo and Ilsa board the plane. Strasser arrives and tries to stop the plane, but Rick shoots him.

• Final action against the adversary Rick no longer commits immoral actions. He shoots Strasser, but given the global situation, this murder is justified.

• Moral awakening Rick understands that his love for Ilsa is not as important as the help he can provide to Laszlo in his fight against Nazi domination.

• Moral decision Rick gives the letters to Laszlo, urges Ilsa to leave with him, and tells Laszlo that Ilsa loves him. Then he leaves to join the Free French Forces.

• Thematic revelation Renault's surprise change at the end of the story, when he decides to join Rick in his fight (a classic example of a double reversal), generates a thematic revelation: everyone must play a role in the fight against fascism.





QUESTIONS / ANSWERS


Q: When you say that every story conveys a moral point of view, do you mean that there should be a moral message behind every story? I rather feel that morality goes against storytelling and tends to produce bad stories.

A: You've just pointed out the biggest mistake authors make regarding the theme: they express it directly in their dialogues, which could be called "on-the-nose dialogues." They send a message, they moralize to the audience. This indeed goes against storytelling and produces bad stories.

To understand the importance of the moral dimension of a story and the right way to express it, one must first distinguish between "moral" and "moralizing." Moralizing writings express, usually through direct commandments or a morally perfect hero, a narrow and simplistic way of acting towards others. Conversely, the moral dimension of a writing appears whenever a character acts towards another or upon themselves. When I say that the best stories convey a moral point of view, it should be understood in this broader sense of the word "moral," which I also distinguish from the strictly psychological point of view.

Every story presents a psychological dimension, as it shows how human beings behave. And some authors convey in their story a strictly psychological theme that can, in itself, be of interest. But these kinds of stories tend to have less impact on the audience. They are internal and non-dramatic, sometimes focused on a single person and their alienation from the world.

Drama is the conflict between at least two people and their beliefs, their values regarding the best way to live. When two people argue, the story always takes on a moral dimension. It deals with what these characters want and what they are willing to do, their actions for and against others, and the moral cost of their conduct in pursuit of what they want.

This is why a good story always expresses the author's point of view on values and the goodness or badness of action. But in a good story, this point of view is not moralizing; it is not a commandment primarily expressed through dialogue, with a hero who is a paragon of virtue. It is a debate of actions, a complex exploration of what constitutes a good action and the difficulty of accomplishing it, expressed through the narrative structure as a deeply flawed character takes steps to achieve their goal.

The ability to express a nuanced moral point of view through narrative structure is one of the hallmarks of a great author. It requires mastery, technique, and the ability to tell the story with art. It is not easy. But the effort is worth it.



Q: I feel that most American films always tell the same story of good versus evil. Is this the framework you advise us to work within? Isn't it too narrow and caricatural?

A: You absolutely should not work within this framework. In my opinion, the opposition of good versus evil is the worst moral debate one can find in a story, a debate almost always "moralizing." No human being is entirely black or white. If you start your story on a good vs. evil opposition, you stop the moral debate before it can even begin, as you cannot explore, through conflict, the unique combination of personal flaws and social forces that drives a character to harm another. The evil character is a "black box," inherently bad, and therefore indecipherable. This type of character is nothing more than a machine for committing bad actions, which means, paradoxically, that they cannot be held responsible for their actions.

You are right to say that many American films, if not most, only repeat the story of good versus evil. This is because Hollywood mainly seeks to tell myths and action stories, often with superheroes and supervillains, that appeal to a wide global audience, especially teenagers and young adults. These are stories that tell the success of a savior, providing viewers with the satisfaction, which they may never find in their own lives, of accomplishing something great. But even among Hollywood myth/action films, the best are those that make the adversary more complex and nuanced than the simplistic villain.

Conclusion: whatever story you write, you must always go beyond the simple opposition of good versus evil to make your hero complex both psychologically and morally. Your story will be all the better for it.

The Story's Universe



Joyce's Ulysses and the "Harry Potter" series are good illustrations of one of the keys to the art of storytelling. On the surface, these two works could not seem more different. Ulysses, a complex, adult, and intellectually stimulating story, is often considered the greatest novel of the 20th century. The "Harry Potter" series are entertaining fantasy stories intended for children. But their authors understood that creating a singular world, unique to their story—and organically linked to the characters—was as essential to the quality of their storytelling as the characters, plot, theme, and dialogues.

Claiming that "Cinema is a visual medium" is extremely misleading. While it is true that films allow us to see stories on a screen and witness incredible special effects that no other medium can offer, the "visual" element that truly affects the audience is the story's universe: a complex and detailed network in which every element has narrative significance, is a physical expression of the network of characters, and particularly of the hero. This key principle applies to cinema as well as to any narrative medium.

You will notice that, in this area, storytelling expresses real life by being the opposite of real life. In life, we are born into a world that already exists and to which we must then adapt. In good stories, it is the characters who come first, before the author conceives the world as an infinitely detailed manifestation of these fictional beings.

T. S. Eliot calls this "the objective correlative." But whatever name you give it, when you create the universe of your story, you begin to add that richness of texture that is one of the hallmarks of excellent storytelling. A good story is a tapestry woven from many threads organized to produce a powerful effect. It is true that one can tell a story without adding the texture of the story's universe. But this is a major loss.

It is important to know that the physical world of the story acts for the author as a "condensor-extender." You have very little time to place a significant amount of elements: characters, plot, symbols, moral debate, and dialogues. You must therefore rely on techniques that allow you to condense meaning into the limited space and time you have. The more meaning you condense into the story, the more it will expand, extend in the audience's mind, its different elements bouncing off each other in a nearly infinite variety of ways.

Gaston Bachelard, in The Poetics of Space, explains "the drama of human dwellings." Meaning is implanted in all kinds of forms and spaces, from shells to houses to drawers. Bachelard raises a crucial point for the storyteller: "The two spaces, intimate space and exterior space, constantly encourage each other in their growth." You will notice that Bachelard speaks of organic storytelling: when you create the right world for your story, you plant certain seeds that will germinate and grow in the hearts and minds of readers or viewers and touch them deeply.

To summarize this part of the writing process: you start with a story that fits into one sentence (the seven steps) and a set of characters. Then you create the forms and spaces that will express these narrative elements, and these forms and spaces will have the desired effects on the hearts and minds of readers or viewers.

It seems that the meaning found in physical forms and spaces is deeper than culture and education; it seems to belong to the human spirit. Hence the depth of its impact on the audience. The different elements of the story's universe thus form a new set of tools and techniques that you can use to tell your story.

Translating the narrative line into a physical universe, which thus provokes certain emotions in the audience, is not an easy task. For it requires speaking two languages—the language of words and the language of images—and making them match exactly throughout the story.

But how to apply these techniques to the creation of your story's universe? You just need to follow these steps (the first three concern the creation of the story's space and the last two the creation of the story's time):



1. We will once again start by relying on the guiding principle, the cement of the story. It will allow you to define the "arena" in which your story will unfold.

2. We will then divide this arena into visual oppositions based on the existing oppositions between characters.

3. Then we will detail this world using three of the four major building blocks—natural settings, man-made spaces, and technology—that constitute the story's universe, and we will emphasize what these forms and spaces mean to the audience.

4. We will then connect the story's universe to the overall development of the hero and apply the fourth building block of the story's universe: time.

5. Finally, we will delve into the development of the story's universe through the narrative structure by creating seven visual steps.





FINDING THE STORY'S UNIVERSE

IN THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE


Since the story's universe is part of the story, it must begin by returning to the core of the narrative, that is, the guiding principle. The story's universe, like the premise, characters, and theme, takes shape from the guiding principle.

For many reasons, it is more difficult to find the story's universe in the guiding principle than to find the premise, characters, and theme. As we have already mentioned, the narrative and the "visual" are two very different languages. But one can learn a language. The problem, in reality, is that the guiding principle and the story's universe operate in opposite ways.

Typically, the guiding principle describes a linear narrative movement, that of a single main character who develops. The story's universe is everything that surrounds the characters simultaneously. In other words, it offers simultaneous elements and actions.

To connect them, take the raw sequence of the narrative line you found in the guiding principle and deploy it three-dimensionally to derive the story's universe. Again, start simple: study the guiding principle and see if you can find a single visual idea that expresses the narrative line.

To see things more concretely, let's revisit the guiding principles of the stories we discussed in chapter 2 (The Premise), and this time try to describe the universe of these stories in a single sentence.

THE STORY'S ARENA


Once you have your guiding principle and your one-sentence description of your story's universe, you must define an arena that marks the physical boundaries of this world. The arena is the basic space of all drama. It is a unique and unified place, enclosed in some way. Everything within the arena is part of the story. Everything outside is not.

Many authors, especially novelists and screenwriters, mistakenly think that because they can go anywhere, they should. This is a grave mistake because if you break the unity of the story's arena, the drama literally dissipates. When there are too many arenas, stories become fragmented and inorganic.

The rule of a single arena is, of course, easier to follow in theater, where one benefits from the natural advantage of the stage setting, delimited by the curtain. Cinema and novels have a larger arena, making a unified space all the more necessary for the unfolding of the drama.





Creating the Arena


We are not trying to push you to adhere to the rigid "Aristotelian unity of place" that claims all action should take place in a single location. There are four main ways to create a single arena without destroying the diversity of locations and actions essential to any good story.





1. Create a general space, then alternate and condense


To achieve this method, describe the broadest field of the story towards the beginning of the narrative. Start with the story's broadest world and the wall that separates it from everything else. Then, as the story progresses, focus on the smaller worlds within the arena.

The general space can literally cover large areas: the vast plains of the West, an entire city, a galaxy, or an ocean. But it can also delimit a small territory: a village, a house, or a bar.

This technique is found in Casablanca, Alien, Spider-Man, L.A. Confidential, The Matrix, Death of a Salesman, A Streetcar Named Desire, Mary Poppins, Groundhog Day, Sunset Boulevard, Nashville, Blood Simple, Meet Me in St. Louis, The Great Gatsby, Shane, Star Wars, and It's a Wonderful Life.





2. Have the hero undertake a journey in a generally uniform area, which develops along a single line


At first glance, this method seems to contradict the idea of a single arena, and it does indeed when not used wisely. If many travel stories seem fragmented, it is because the hero travels through many very different and disconnected places, each giving the feeling of being an isolated episode.

A sense of a single arena can only be created if the area in which the hero travels has remained fundamentally the same. Like a desert, an ocean, a river, or a jungle. But even then, try to make the journey a single, easily identifiable guiding line, and present the area simply, from beginning to end, to give it a sense of unity.

Good illustrations of the single guiding line journey can be found in Titanic, The Wild Bunch, The Blues Brothers, Jacques Tati's Trafic, and The African Queen's Odyssey.





3. Have the hero undertake a circular journey in a generally unified area


This method works much like the previous one, except that in the end, the hero returns home. The advantage of the single guiding line that gives the audience a sense of a unified and oriented path is lost. But by returning to the starting point, home, the hero's transformation is highlighted in contrast to this world, which has not changed.

The circular journey is the basis of works such as The Wizard of Oz, Joyce's Ulysses, Finding Nemo, King Kong, Don Quixote, Big, Heart of Darkness, Beau Geste, Adrift, Deliverance, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Field of Dreams, and Alice in Wonderland.





4. Take the hero out of their element (fish out of water)
First, place your hero in an initial arena. Spend enough time there to clearly show all the talents he possesses that are specific to this world. Then launch him into another world—without lingering on the journey—and show that the talents the hero used in the first world, while seemingly unsuitable, actually work just as well in the second.

This approach is used in Beverly Hills Cop, Crocodile Dundee, Black Rain, and to a lesser extent, but still notably, in Witness and Dances with Wolves.

Strictly speaking, stories of heroes out of their element take place in two different arenas. This is why, unsurprisingly, they often feel like two-part stories. What cements them is that the hero uses the same talents in both places. So much so that the audience ends up thinking that even if the two arenas seem very different, they are fundamentally identical.

One of the keys to this technique is not to linger in the first arena. It is only the springboard for the main story, which unfolds in the second. Once you have presented the talents the hero uses in the first arena, it has fulfilled its function.

Oppositions within the arena

Characters are not created to fill a story universe, however fabulous it may be. The story universe is created to express its characters, particularly its hero, and to let them express themselves.

Just as you have defined the network of characters by dramatizing the oppositions that exist between them, you must define the story universe in your unique arena by dramatizing visual oppositions. To do this, you must return to the oppositions between characters and their values.

Review your network of characters and examine all the ways these characters confront each other. Pay particular attention to conflicts of values, as it is primarily for reasons of values that the main characters fight. From these oppositions, you will begin to see visual oppositions also emerge in the physical world.

Study these visual oppositions carefully and try to find three or four that can become central. Let’s now examine some examples to better understand how these visual oppositions stem from the oppositions between characters.

IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE

(novella, The Greatest Gift, by Philip Van Doren Stern, screenplay by Francis Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Frank Capra, 1946)

It’s a Wonderful Life is structured so that the audience can see two different versions of the same town. You will notice that this important element of the story universe, the town, is a direct expression of the fundamental opposition between George Bailey and Mr. Potter. And each version of the town is a physical manifestation of the values of the character it represents. Pottersville is the result of the tyranny and unlimited greed of one man. Bedford Falls is the consequence of democracy, honesty, and kindness.

SUNSET BOULEVARD

(Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder, and D. M. Marshman Jr, 1950)

The central opposition of Sunset Boulevard revolves around the modest screenwriter Joe Gillis—who still believes in good work under the veneer of the money chase—and the aging rich movie star Norma Desmond. This opposition is visually translated: Joe’s cramped apartment vs. Norma’s decrepit mansion; Los Angeles, a modern, sunny, open city vs. a dark gothic house; youth vs. old age; modest outsiders trying to break through vs. the grand, secure, but cruel movie studio; ordinary workers of the entertainment industry vs. the aristocracy of movie stars.

THE GREAT GATSBY

(F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925)

In The Great Gatsby, the main oppositions are Gatsby and Tom, Gatsby and Daisy, Gatsby and Nick, and Nick and Tom (note the four-cornered system of oppositions). Each of these characters represents a different version of the modest Midwesterner who came east to make a fortune. The first opposition of the story universe is therefore the plains of the Midwest to the tall towers and elegant villas of the East Coast. Tom is a nouveau riche, but less "new" than Gatsby. There is thus an opposition among the rich of Long Island, an opposition between well-established East Egg, where Tom and Daisy live, and the equally wealthy but more modern West Egg, where Gatsby lives. Moreover, Tom and Daisy’s villa is described as opulent but classic, while Gatsby’s and the way he uses it are depicted as the height of flashy bad taste.

Gatsby made his fortune through his illegal bootlegging activities while Nick is an honest and hardworking stockbroker. Nick rents Gatsby’s small guest house from where he can watch the superficial parties organized by the hero. Tom is a violent man who cheats on his wife. Fitzgerald thus creates a contrast between Tom’s villa and his mistress’s gas station. The author creates a final opposition of sub-worlds when he depicts the valley of ashes, the hidden waste of the great capitalist engine represented by New York and Long Island. In a final thematic explosion, he compares New York, the pinnacle of American "civilization," to the city as it was before its development, still full of promise, "the green breast of a new world."

KING KONG

(James Creelman and Ruth Rose, 1931)

The main contrast in King Kong is that between producer Carl Denham and the immense prehistoric beast, Kong. The main opposition in the story universe is thus between Manhattan Island, a man-made, over-civilized but also extremely cruel world, where Denham, the image maker, is "king"; and Skull Island, the extremely cruel state of nature where Kong, the master of physical strength, is king. Within this main opposition is a triangular contrast of sub-worlds that opposes New Yorkers, Skull Island villagers, and prehistoric jungle animals, each group involved in a different form of survival struggle.

DANCES WITH WOLVES

(novel and screenplay by Michael Blake, 1990)

Throughout the story of Dances with Wolves, the central opposition of characters and values evolves, and with it, the main visual oppositions. Initially, the hero, John Dunbar, wants to participate in the construction of the American frontier before it disappears. The first opposition of the story universe is between the Civil War, in the east, where the nation has been corrupted by slavery, and the vast plains of the Wild West, where America’s promises have retained their freshness. Within the world of the western plains, the apparent value conflict opposes the white soldier, Dunbar, who believes in building the American nation, to the Lakota Sioux, who seem to be savages seeking to destroy it.

But Michael Blake describes the sub-worlds in a way that shakes this apparent value opposition. Dunbar’s cavalry outpost is a rat hole, devoid of life, a muddy scar that disfigures the landscape. The Sioux village is a small utopia, a circle of tipis by the river, with grazing horses and playing children. As the story progresses, Blake shows that the true value opposition lies between the expansionist American world that treats animals and Indians as objects to be destroyed, and the Indian world that is in harmony with nature and treats each human being according to their deep qualities.

L.A. CONFIDENTIAL

(novel by James Ellroy, screenplay by Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson, 1997)

In L.A. Confidential, the main opposition between characters is at first glance between the police and the murderers. In reality, it is between police investigators who believe in different versions of justice and a murderous police captain and a corrupt district attorney. That’s why the first visual opposition presented by the voice-over is that of a City of Angels, an apparent utopia vs. a racist, corrupt, and oppressive Los Angeles. This essential opposition is subdivided when the three main investigators are introduced: Bud White, the "real" cop, who confuses justice with vengeance; Jack Vincennes, the "cool" cop, who supplements his income by acting as a technical advisor for a TV police series and who arrests people for money; and Ed Exley, the smart cop who knows the political rules of the justice game and intends to use them to achieve his ambitions. The story stages this opposition of characters and values through different sub-worlds by contrasting the rich, white, and corrupt Los Angeles that committed the crime with the poor, black Los Angeles to which it is attributed.

DETAILING THE STORY UNIVERSE

The visual oppositions and the story universe itself are detailed by combining three main elements: territory (natural settings), populations (man-made spaces), and technology (tools). The fourth element, time, corresponds to how the original world you created develops over the course of the story, something we will discuss a little later. Let’s start by studying the natural settings.

Natural settings

Never choose the natural setting of your story at random. For a reader or viewer, each setting carries a multitude of meanings. As Bachelard says, "a psychologist of the imagination [...] realizes that the cosmos shapes man, transforms a man of the hills into a man of the island and the river [...] that the house remodels man." You must know some of the possible meanings of various natural settings, such as hills, islands, and rivers, to determine if one of them could be a good expression of your premise, characters, and theme.

The ocean

In the collective imagination, the ocean is divided into two distinct places: the surface and the depths. The surface is the quintessential two-dimensional landscape, a flat expanse as far as the eye can see. Therefore, the surface seems abstract while being completely natural. This flat abstract surface, like a vast chessboard, intensifies the sense of competition, the game for survival played on the largest scale.

The depths of the ocean embody the quintessential three-dimensional landscape, where all creatures, light, live at different levels of depth. This feeling of weightlessness, of floating, is very often present when the human mind imagines a utopia, which explains why the depths of the ocean have often hosted imaginary utopian worlds.

But the depths of the ocean are also a terrifying tomb, an immense impersonal hand that quietly seizes everything on the surface, living or not, to draw it into the infinite darkness of the abyss. The ocean is this immense mouth where ancient worlds, prehistoric creatures, secrets of the past, and old treasures it has engulfed await discovery.

Among ocean stories are Moby Dick, Titanic, Finding Nemo, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, The Little Mermaid, Atlantis, The Sea Wolf, Master and Commander, The Odyssey of the Submarine Nerka, Mutiny on the Bounty, The Hunt for Red October, Jaws, and The Yellow Submarine.

Space

Space is the "up there" ocean, an infinite expanse of dark nothingness that hosts an unlimited diversity of other worlds. Like the depths of the ocean, space is three-dimensional. Like the surface of the ocean, space seems both abstract and natural. As everything moves in the shadows, although they are individual and unique, they are also reduced to their most essential quality. There is "the spaceship," "the human being," "the robot," and "the alien." Science fiction stories often use the form of myth not only because myth involves a journey but also because myth is a form of story that explores the most fundamental human distinctions.

As the setting of space carries the promise of an unlimited diversity of other worlds, it is a place of endless adventures. Adventure stories always have to do with a sense of discovery, novelty, the unheard-of, which can be both exciting and terrifying. At this point in human history, literature, and cinema, space is the only natural setting where the promise of unlimited adventures still makes sense (the ocean is also largely unexplored territory. But as we struggle to imagine a true community inhabiting it, the ocean is only the setting of a human world in fantasy).

Space is the setting for science fiction stories such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dune, the "Star Wars" saga, Blade Runner, Apollo 13, Forbidden Planet, many episodes of The Twilight Zone, the "Star Trek" series and films, and the "Alien" saga.

The forest

The main narrative quality of the forest is that it constitutes a natural cathedral. The tall trees, with their leaves above us that protect us, evoke a wise old man who assures us that, whatever problems we face, they will resolve with time. It is the place where contemplative people take refuge and where lovers hide.

But the intense intimacy provided by the forest can also be ominous. The forest is where people get lost. It is the place where ghosts and past lives hide. It is where hunters stalk their prey, and these prey are often human. The forest is less wild than the jungle; the jungle can kill anyone at any time. The forest, when it accomplishes its frightening work, first causes mental damage. It kills more slowly than the jungle but is just as deadly.

The forest is the natural setting of many fairy tales as well as stories such as Sleepy Hollow, The Lord of the Rings, the "Harry Potter" series, Return of the Jedi, Shrek, Excalibur, As You Like It, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Song of Solomon, The Wizard of Oz, John McCabe, The Wolf Man, The Blair Witch Project, and Miller’s Crossing.

The jungle

The jungle is the state of nature. Its first impact on the imagination is a feeling of suffocation. Everything seems to grab you. The jungle gives the audience a sense of nature’s superiority over man. In this environment, man is reduced to the state of a beast.

Ironically, this primal place is also one of the two natural settings that express the theory of evolution, this modern theory of change.

The world of the jungle is found in the "Star Wars" saga; the Tarzan stories, including Greystoke; King Kong; The African Queen; Jurassic Park and The Lost World; The Emerald Forest; Aguirre, the Wrath of God; Mosquito Coast; Fitzcarraldo; The Eyes in the Trees; Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now.

The desert and ice

The desert and ice have always been places of agony and death. Even stories struggle to flourish there. The desert and ice seem completely impersonal in their brutality.

For something valuable to emerge from them, strong personalities must have come to harden and flourish in isolation. A rare example of a world of ice depicted as a utopia is found in Mark Helprin’s novel Winter’s Tale, which presents a village whose sense of community is strengthened when winter cuts it off from the rest of the world and freezes its lake, on which villagers enjoy all sorts of winter entertainments.

Deserts and ice worlds play an important role in the "Star Wars" saga, Fargo, Lawrence of Arabia, Beau Geste, Dune, The Ballad of Cable Hogue, The Searchers, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Once Upon a Time in the West, The Wild Bunch, The Sheltering Sky, The Gold Rush, and The Call of the Wild.

The island

The island is an ideal setting for creating a story in a social context. Like the ocean and space, the island is both highly abstract and completely natural. It is a miniature version of the planet, a small patch of land surrounded by water. The island is, by definition, an isolated place. That’s why, in stories, it is often the laboratory of the human race, a paradise or a solitary hell, a place where a special world can be built and where new forms of life can be created and tested.

The isolated and abstract nature of the island explains why this setting is often used to depict utopias or dystopias. And more than the jungle, the island is the ideal place to stage the workings of evolution.

Among the stories that use the island as a central setting are Robinson Crusoe, The Tempest, Gulliver’s Travels, The Incredibles, King Kong, Treasure Island, The Mysterious Island, The Island of Dr. Moreau, Lord of the Flies, Cast Away, the TV series Lost. The best use of the island in the history of storytelling is probably found in the series Gilligan’s Island.

In many ways, the island offers perhaps the most complex narrative possibilities of all natural settings. Let’s try to understand how to best exploit the island world. Note that the best way to use the inherent meaning of this natural setting is through narrative structure.

• Take the time, at the beginning, to present the normal society and the role the characters play in it (need).

• Send the characters to an island (desire).

• Create a new society based on different rules and values (desire).

• Make the relationships between the characters very different from those in the original society (plan).

• Through conflict, show what works and what doesn’t (opponent).

• Have the characters test new things when they encounter a problem (twist or realization).

The mountain

The highest of all places has become, in the collective imagination, the place of greatness. It is where strong men go to prove themselves—usually through isolation, meditation, discomfort, and direct confrontation with nature. The mountain top is the world of the natural philosopher, the great thinker who must understand the forces of nature to live in harmony with them, and sometimes control them.

Structurally, the mountain, the highest place, is associated with realization, the most mental of the twenty-two steps of narrative structure (see Chapter 8, "Plot"). Twists-revelations are moments of discovery and are essential to transform the plot and push it to a "higher," more intense level. Again, the mountain setting creates a direct relationship between space and person, in this case, between height and understanding.

This direct relationship between space and person is also found in the negative expression of the mountain, which is often described as a place of hierarchy, privilege, and tyranny, usually inhabited by an aristocrat who rules from above over the common people.

KEY POINT: The mountain is generally opposed to the plain.

The mountain and the plain are the only two main natural settings that form a visual contrast. Thus, authors often use the comparative method to highlight the essential and contradictory qualities of each.

The mountain world plays an important role in the story of Moses, the Greek myths of the gods of Mount Olympus, many fairy tales, The Magic Mountain, Lost Horizon, Brokeback Mountain, Batman Begins, The Snows of Kilimanjaro, A Farewell to Arms, The Deer Hunter, The Last of the Mohicans, Dances with Wolves, Shane, The Shining, and several other horror films.

The plain

This flat surface is wide open and accessible to all. Unlike the jungle, which is oppressive, the plain is completely free. That’s why it is, in many stories, the place of equality, freedom, and the rights of everyone. But this freedom comes at a cost and does not mean the absence of conflict. Like the surface of the ocean, this extremely flat expanse takes on an abstract character that highlights the fight or struggle for survival.

As for the negative aspects, the plain is often considered the place where mediocre people live. Unlike the happy few, who reside at the mountain top, the multitude of average people live with the rest of the herd, below. Unable to think for themselves, they need to be led, which usually leads to their destruction.

The plain is the natural setting of most westerns, including Shane and The Big Country, as well as Days of Heaven, Dances with Wolves, Lost Horizon, The Snows of Kilimanjaro, A Farewell to Arms, Blood Simple, and Field of Dreams.

The river

The river is an extremely powerful natural setting, perhaps the most powerful of all those that can be used in storytelling. The river is a path, making it a perfect physical manifestation for mythical stories whose structure is based on the journey.

But the river is more than just a path. It is a road that leads to something or away from something, reinforcing the feeling that the journey is an organic line of development, not just a series of episodes. In Heart of Darkness, for example, the hero travels up the river, delving deeper into the jungle. The line of human development linked to this journey leads from civilization to the hell of barbarism.

In The African Queen, the hero makes the journey and the reverse process by going down the river, to emerge from the jungle. His development begins in a jungle, an infernal landscape of death, isolation, and madness, and moves towards the human world of commitment and love.

The river marks a physical, moral, and emotional passage in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Deliverance, Heart of Darkness and its adaptations, Apocalypse Now, A River Runs Through It, and The African Queen.

Beware of visual clichés! With natural settings, it is very easy to fall into the trap of commonplaces: "My hero is going to have a great realization? I’ll send him to the top of a mountain." Use natural settings only if they are essential to your story. And above all, use them in an original way.
Weather Conditions

Weather, like natural settings, can be used as a powerful physical representation of the characters' intimate experiences or to evoke strong feelings in the audience. Below is a list of classic correlations between weather and emotions:

• Lightning and thunder: Passion, terror, death

• Rain: Sadness, solitude, boredom, comfort

• Wind: Destruction, desolation

• Fog: Impenetrability, mystery

• Sun: Cheerfulness, amusement, freedom, but also hidden corruption under a pleasant appearance

• Snow: Sleep, serenity, almost inexorable death

Again, it is important to avoid repeating these classic correlations. Instead, try to use weather in a surprising or ironic way.

Man-Made Spaces

Man-made spaces are even more useful than natural spaces because they have the power to solve one of the most difficult problems an author faces: how to represent a society? In narratives, all man-made spaces are condensers-extenders. Each is a physical expression, a microcosm of the hero and the society in which he lives.

The author's problem is to represent this society on paper so that the audience can understand the deep relationship that unites the hero with others. Below are the main man-made spaces that can help you in this endeavor.

The House

For the narrator, the house is the very first of man-made spaces. The house is the first enclosure of the person. Its original physical elements define the development of the person's mind and the well-being of that mind in the present. The house is also the home of the family, which is the central unit of social life and the central unit of drama. Thus, all fiction authors must carefully consider the role the house can play in their story.

For your characters and your audience, no place can be more intimate than the house. But this house is also filled with visual oppositions that you must know to express its full dramatic potential.

Security vs. Adventures

The house is, first and foremost, the great protector. "In every dwelling, even in the castle, finding the initial shell is the first task of the phenomenologist." In other words, "always, in our reveries, the house is a great cradle. [...] Life begins well, it begins enclosed, protected, all warm in the bosom of the house."

The house may initially be the shell, the cradle, or the nest of the human being. But this protective cocoon is also what makes its opposite possible: the house is the solid foundation from which we venture out to discover the world. "The house [...] breathes. It is armor clothing and then it extends to infinity. In other words, we live there alternately in security and in adventure. It is a cell and it is a world." Very often, in stories, the first step of the adventure, the idea of adventure, occurs at the window. A character looks outside through the eye of the house and may even hear the whistle of a train calling them. And they dream of leaving.

The Ground vs. the Sky

The second opposition represented by the house is that of the ground and the sky. The house has deep roots. It rests against the earth. It tells the world and its inhabitants that it is solid and trustworthy.

But the house also rises towards the sky. Like a proud miniature cathedral, it wishes to offer the best, the "highest," to its inhabitants. "All strongly terrestrial beings – and a house is strongly terrestrial – remain subject to the attraction of the celestial, aerial world. The well-rooted house likes to have a branch that is sensitive to the wind, or an attic that can hear the rustling of leaves."

The Warm House

The warm house is large (though it is generally not a mansion). It has enough rooms, nooks, and crannies for each of its inhabitants to thrive in privacy. It should also be noted that the warm house carries within it two opposing elements: the security and comfort of the shell and the diversity made possible only by its size.

Authors often intensify the warmth of the large, diverse house by using the technique known as "domestic hum." This is Pieter Bruegel's technique (used in paintings such as The Hunters in the Snow and Winter Landscape with Skaters and a Bird Trap) applied to the house. In the domestic hum, all the different individuals of a family engage in their respective activities. Individuals and small groups may gather for a particular moment, then return to their affairs. This is a perfect representation of community on the scale of the house. Each person is both an individual and a part of the family, and even when each character is in a different part of the house, the audience feels a special connection linking them together.

The large, diverse house and the domestic hum can be found in stories such as You Can't Take It with You; Meet Me in St. Louis; My Father and Us; The Cider House Rules; Pride and Prejudice; The Magnificent Ambersons; The Royal Tenenbaums; Steel Magnolias; It's a Wonderful Life; the TV series The Waltons; David Copperfield; How Green Was My Valley; Mary Poppins and The Yellow Submarine.

The power of the warm house relies partly on the childhood memories, real or imagined, it evokes. Audience members lived in a large, comfortable house when they were young, and if some of them lived in a slum, they can always look at the large warm house and see in it the childhood they would have dreamed of having. This is why the warm house is so often used in memory stories, such as Jean Shepherd's A Christmas Story, and it is also why American authors so often use dilapidated Victorian homes with many gables and pleasant nooks set in old-fashioned settings.

The bar can be considered a variant of the house. Like it, it can be warm or terrifying. In the TV series Cheers, the bar is a utopia, a community where "everybody knows your name." The regulars are always in the same place, always making the same mistakes, and always maintaining the same strange relationships with each other. The bar is also a warm place simply because it is a place where no one has to change.

CASABLANCA

(play, Everybody Comes to Rick’s, by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, screenplay by Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein, and Howard Koch, 1942)

The universe of the story played as important a role in the success of Casablanca as in the most elaborate fantasies, myths, and science fiction stories. And everything is centered around the bar, Rick's Café Américain.

What makes the universe of Casablanca – the bar – unique and gives it immense power over the audience is that it is both a dystopia and a utopia. It is in this bar that the king of the underworld has taken up residence.

Rick's Café Américain is a dystopia in that everyone wants to escape Casablanca, and everyone spends their time here waiting, endlessly, to be able to leave. But there is no escape. It is also a dystopia in that everything is easy money and bribes, a perfect expression of the hero's cynicism, selfishness, and despair.

But this bar is also a fabulous utopia. Rick reigns there as a master, a king surrounded by dozens of courtiers who pay him homage. The café is a large warm house full of nooks and crannies occupied by all sorts of characters. Each of them knows their place and appreciates it. There is Carl, the waiter, and Sacha, the bartender; Abdul, the bouncer; Émile, who runs the casino; and Rick's sidekick, Sam, the musician. And there is also Berger, the old-fashioned Norwegian shadow fighter, waiting to come under Laszlo's command. This bar is also the perfect hiding place for the letters of transit, which remain under Sam's piano lid.

In a world of contradictions, this warm house is the home of fashion and trends, embodied by King Rick, impeccably dressed in his white dinner jacket, always courteous and witty, even under the threat of the Nazis. But it is also a world that lives at night, and its king has his dark sides. He calls the two murdered messengers the "honorable dead." This king is Hades.

By creating a closed world that is both dystopia and utopia, the screenwriters of Casablanca have shaped a Möbius strip universe that never ends. Rick's Café Américain will always be open every night. People will continue to seek refuge there; the captain will continue to gamble and take advantage of women; the Germans will continue to make arrogant intrusions. This café is one of those timeless places that make great stories, and it continues to exist because it is a reassuring haven where everyone appreciates the role they play.

Far from being limited to being the place where everyone seeks to obtain an exit visa, Rick's bar, in distant Casablanca, represents the ideal community that no spectator wishes to leave.

The Terrifying House

Opposite the warm house, the terrifying house is generally a house that has gone from being a cocoon to a prison. In stories that have used it well, if the house is terrifying, it is because it is a manifestation of the character's weakness and need. This house is a materialization of the hero's greatest fear. In the most extreme cases, the character's mind is so corrupted that the house is also in ruins. But it remains a prison.

In Great Expectations, Miss Havisham is a slave to her own dilapidated villa because she has chosen to martyr herself on the altar of her unrequited love. Her mind has been corrupted by bitterness. And her house is a perfect image of her mind. In Wuthering Heights, the house is a horrible prison because it is where Cathy abandoned true love and because Heathcliff's bitterness drove him to commit horrible acts against its inhabitants in Cathy's name.

Horror stories place so much importance on the haunted house that it has become the quintessential setting for this form. Structurally, the terrifying or haunted house represents the power of the past over the present. The house itself becomes a weapon seeking to avenge the sins committed by ancestors. In such stories, the house is not necessarily a decrepit, creaky mansion with slamming doors, moving walls, and dark secret passages. It can be the simple suburban houses of Poltergeist or A Nightmare on Elm Street, or the grand mountain hotel of The Shining. At the top of this mountain, the isolation and the hotel's past sins do not lead the hero to higher thoughts; they drive him insane.

When the terrifying house is a large Gothic building, it is often inhabited by a family of aristocrats. These men live off the work of others, who often reside below, in the valley, simply because they are not "well-born." The house is either too empty for its size, meaning there is no life in its structure, or filled with expensive but outdated furniture that oppresses due to its number. In the end, the family is annihilated, and if the story is taken to the extreme, the house burns, devours its inhabitants, or collapses on them. Examples of this type can be found in The Fall of the House of Usher and other Poe stories, Rebecca, Jane Eyre, Dracula, The Innocents, The Amityville Horror, Sunset Boulevard, Frankenstein, Long Day's Journey into Night, and some stories by Chekhov and Strindberg.

In more modern stories, the terrifying house is a prison because it is neither large nor diverse. It is small and cramped; its walls are thin or completely absent. The family is crammed inside; therefore, there is no community, no isolated and comfortable corners where each person would have enough space to become who they truly are. In these houses, the family, the basic unit of drama, is a source of constant conflict. The terrifying house is like a pressure cooker; its inhabitants cannot escape, and it eventually explodes. Examples include Death of a Salesman, American Beauty, A Streetcar Named Desire, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Long Day's Journey into Night, The Glass Menagerie, Carrie, Psycho, and The Sixth Sense.

The Cellar vs. the Attic

Within the house, the main opposition is that of the cellar and the attic. The cellar is a basement, a hell. It is the tomb of the house, the place where corpses, dark memories of the past, and terrible family secrets are buried. But they do not stay buried for long. They are just waiting to return, and when they succeed in making their return, in the living room or the bedroom, they usually destroy the family. These cellar ghosts can be horrible, as in Psycho, or amusing, as in Arsenic and Old Lace.

The cellar is also the place where plots are hatched. Plots come from the darkest part of the house and the darkest part of the mind. The cellar is thus the natural workplace of criminals and revolutionaries. This technique is used in Notes from Underground, The Lavender Hill Mob, The Silence of the Lambs, and M.

The attic is sloped and cramped, but it is at the top of the structure, where the house meets the sky. When inhabited, the attic is the place where great thoughts and great works of art, still unknown to the world, are created (Moulin Rouge). The attic also has the advantage of providing height and perspective. Its inhabitants can look out their tiny window and observe the Bruegel-like community scenes unfolding below in the street.

The attic, like the cellar, is also a place where things are hidden. As the attic is the "head" of the house, these hidden things, when terrifying, relate to madness (Jane Eyre, The Haunting). But more often, they are positive things, like treasures or memories. A character discovers an old chest in the attic that opens a window to their past or that of their ancestors.

The Path

Among the different man-made places, the opposite of the house is the path. The house encourages us to snuggle within it, to live a moment out of time, to feel comfortable, to feel at home. The path encourages us to go out, to explore, to change. The house implies a simultaneous story, everything happening at the same time. The path implies a linear story, each thing happening along a guiding line of development.

George Sand wrote: "What is more beautiful than a path? It is the symbol and image of an active and varied life." The path is always thin. It is a fine line, the simplest and most stripped-down mark of man, surrounded by the wild, cruel, and impersonal world. The path therefore requires courage. But it offers an almost infinite diversity of perspectives regarding the traveler's future. The path, whatever its width, carries within it the promise of a destination worth reaching.

Myths are centered on this fundamental opposition between the house and the path. The classic myth begins at home. The hero embarks on a journey, encounters many adversaries who test him, and returns home after learning what he already was deep inside. The myth tends to show that the house is not well used. The hero has not created his unique self in this safe place or has felt oppressed there. The path has forced him to test his skills. But the hero of the myth does not become a new man on the path. He must return home to become aware of what he has always been, but in a deeper way.

TECHNIQUE: THE VEHICLE

If travel stories often seem fragmented, it is either because they take place in too many different arenas or because the hero encounters a succession of adversaries along the way. This is why the vehicle in which the hero travels is one of the keys to the functioning of this type of story. The rule is simple: the larger the vehicle, the more unified the arena will appear. And the larger the vehicle, the easier it will be to bring in adversaries. They will then be recurring adversaries who, with the hero, will create a unified arena within the vehicle itself.

Among travel stories that use large vehicles, there are Titanic and Ship of Fools (ship), Murder on the Orient Express and Night Train to Munich (train), and Almost Famous (bus).

The City

The largest of man-made microcosms is the city. It is so large that it breaks the boundaries of the microcosm and becomes sprawling. The city consists of hundreds of buildings, millions of people. And yet, it is a unique life experience that must somehow be translated into narrative terms.

To codify the vast field covered by the city, authors often reduce the city to a smaller microcosm. The most popular of these is undoubtedly the institution. An institution is an organization with a unique function, boundaries, set of rules, hierarchy of powers, and mode of operation. The metaphor of the institution transforms the city into a highly organized military operation where a large number of people are defined and related to each other solely based on the role they play in the whole.

Very often, authors who describe the city as an institution create a large, unique building with many floors and rooms, including a vast hall with hundreds of perfectly aligned desks. The city as an institution can be found in The Hospital, American Beauty, Network, Double Indemnity, The Incredibles, and The Matrix.

TECHNIQUE: COMBINING CITY AND NATURAL SETTINGS

To find a metaphor for the city, fantasy uses an approach that is the opposite of that of the institution. Instead of enclosing the city in a highly controlled organization, fantasy opens the city by imagining it as a kind of natural setting like a mountain or a jungle. The advantage of this technique is that it makes the sprawling city a unit with distinctive signs that the audience can recognize. But – more importantly – it also allows for the maximum exploitation of the city's immense potential – positive or negative.

The Mountain City

The mountain peak is a frequently used natural metaphor to represent the city, especially very vertical cities like New York. The tallest towers and highest mountains are the residence of the wealthiest and most powerful people. Middle-class people live in medium-sized towers while the poor crawl in low-ceilinged slums at the foot of the mountain. Highly stylized crime fantasies, such as "Batman," often use the mountain metaphor.

The Ocean City

To represent the city, the ocean is an even more powerful natural metaphor than the classic but predictable mountain. With this metaphor, the author usually starts with the rooftops, which are depicted so that the audience feels like they are floating on waves. Then the story "dives" below the surface to follow several threads, or characters, who live on different levels of this three-dimensional world and are generally unaware of the presence of other people "swimming" in this sea. Films as different as Under the Roofs of Paris, Wings of Desire, and The Yellow Submarine take great advantage of this ocean metaphor.

The ocean is also the ultimate metaphor when depicting the city in its most positive aspect, as a playground where different individuals can live in freedom, originality, and love. In fantasy, the main way to achieve this goal is to literally make the city dwellers float. This gives them the power to fly. But it should also be noted that when characters float, ceilings become floors, nothing is closed, and people can experience the ultimate freedom that comes from imagination. Floating is a metaphor that represents the hidden potential within the triviality of the city; when one looks at the predictable world with a new perspective, suddenly, everything becomes possible.

In realistic films that treat the city as an ocean, the floating effect is created by the camera's eye. At the beginning of Under the Roofs of Paris, for example, the camera glides over the rooftops and then dives below the "ocean" surface, entering through an open window while "swimming." After observing a few characters for a moment, it exits, still "swimming," through a window, before slipping into another to capture a new group of characters. All of this is part of the story structure, created by the screenwriter and designed to evoke a sense of vast community within the immense ocean of the city.

MARY POPPINS

(books by P. L. Travers, screenplay by Bill Walsh and Don Da Gradi, 1964)

Mary Poppins is a story based on the ocean city metaphor. Mary floats down from the sky to begin her stay with the Banks. The neighbor, a sea captain, observes her from his roof (the deck of his "ship") with his first officer. Mary teaches the children that one can float when they love spending their days laughing. And Bert and the chimney sweeps dance on the rooftops, which they call the "sea of enchantment." Full of energy, they waddle on the waves (the gables) and defy gravity until the captain fires a cannonball. The chimney sweep then disappears below the ocean surface and waits for it to be time to dance again.

The Jungle City
The jungle city is the opposite of the ocean city. There, the three-dimensional aspect of the city is not liberating; it is a source of death—enemies are hidden everywhere, and a deadly attack can come from anywhere at any moment. Cities of this type are generally dense and humid, their inhabitants depicted as animals differing only in their ways of killing. This metaphor has been used in many detective stories, to the point that it has become a cliché. Among the stories that use the jungle city metaphor more originally are Pépé le Moko (the Casbah of Algiers), Spider-Man (New York), Batman Begins (Gotham), The Jungle (Chicago), Blade Runner (Los Angeles), M (Berlin), and King Kong (New York).

The forest city

The forest city is a positive version of the jungle city. With this technique, buildings are miniature versions of the city, more human; it's as if people lived in trees. The city resembles a neighborhood or village flanked by impersonal towers. The city depicted as a forest generally goes hand in hand with a utopian vision of the world, where characters enjoy the benefits of bustling urban life while also experiencing the comfort and coziness of home among the trees. This technique is used in films such as You Can't Take It with You and Ghostbusters.

GHOSTBUSTERS

(Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, 1984)

Ghostbusters is a teenage adventure film set in New York. At the beginning of the story, the three "musketeers" are professors at a warm university that evokes a city. They study paranormal phenomena, which allows them to conduct all sorts of wacky experiments with pretty girls. They then create a business that lets them earn large sums of money by wearing funny uniforms, driving a customized ambulance, using super gadgets, and living in a firehouse. For these boys, the firehouse is the ultimate clubhouse. They sleep together in a dormitory, where they dream of sexy girls, and when called for a job, they slide down the "tree trunk," or pole, and embark on wild adventures.

Miniatures

A miniature is a shrunken society. The miniature is chaos theory applied to storytelling; it presents the audience with different levels of order. The order of the universe, which is too difficult to grasp because we cannot see the world as a whole, is clarified when the universe is shrunk.

In stories, all man-made spaces are forms of miniatures. The only difference is the scale. The miniature is one of the fundamental techniques of the storytelling universe because it is an excellent condenser-expander. By its very nature, it does not present things one after the other, successively. It shows many things at once in all the complexity of their relationships.

The miniature can have three different functions in a story:

1. It allows the audience to see the story universe as a whole.

2. It allows the author to express different aspects, or facets, of the same character.

3. It allows for the display of power, and often tyranny.

The classic documentary by Ray and Charles Eames, Powers of Ten, illustrates well how the miniature works in storytelling. From a distance of one yard, we observe a couple picnicking on a lawn. A second later, we see the same couple from ten yards, then a hundred yards, a thousand, ten thousand, etc. The perspective increases to the power of ten until we can only observe space from an inconceivable height. The perspective quickly tightens on the couple, then reverses the course of the power of ten by diving deeper and deeper into the microcosmic world of cells, molecules, and atoms. Each perspective presents a complete sub-world, an order of things that explains, in a condensed way, how the world works.

In storytelling, the miniature fulfills the same function. But it does not merely factually show how the different pieces of the story universe fit together. It shows what matters. "In the miniature, values condense and enrich."

CITIZEN KANE

(Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles, 1941)

Citizen Kane is a story built on the miniature. In the opening sequence, Kane, on his deathbed, drops a glass paperweight representing a cabin in the snow that shatters on the floor. It is a miniature of Kane's childhood, his lost childhood. Then comes a newsreel about Kane, which is a miniature of his life, told from a distant and pseudo-historical perspective. The newsreel presents Kane's estate, Xanadu, which is a miniature of the entire world recreated behind walls to satisfy Kane's personal pleasure and need for domination. Each miniature presents the audience with a very important image of this rich, lonely, and sometimes tyrannical man. But at the same time, these multiple miniatures evoke one of the story's themes: you can never truly know someone, no matter how many perspectives and narrators you use.

THE SHINING

(novel by Stephen King, screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson, 1980)

In The Shining, Jack Torrance, procrastinating on his writing work, sees in miniature the vast labyrinthine garden behind the hotel. Leaning in for a better look, taking the "God's perspective," he discerns the tiny figures of his wife and son navigating it. The miniature here is a foreshadowing (a kind of temporal miniature) that announces the moment when he will attempt to murder his son in the maze at the end of the story.

From large to small / from small to large

Changing the size of characters is an excellent way to draw attention to the relationship these characters have with the story universe. It creates a true reversal in the minds of readers or viewers, who are forced to look at the characters and the world in a radically new way. The audience is suddenly compelled to question the underlying principles of what they considered given: the very foundations of the world are now completely different.

If fantasy exists, it is partly because this genre allows us to look at things as if we were seeing them for the first time. More than any other narrative technique, shrinking the character is an excellent way to achieve this effect. When a character shrinks, they regress and become a child again. On the negative side, they feel a sudden loss of power and may even be terrified by their own surroundings, now massive and dominating. On the positive side, the character, like the audience, is amazed to look at the world with fresh eyes. "The man with the magnifying glass [...] is childhood rediscovered. It gives the botanist the child's magnifying gaze. [...] Thus the tiny, narrow gate if there ever was one, opens a world."

At the moment of reversal, the underlying principles of the world suddenly escape the audience. And yet, this world remains intensely real. Suddenly, the everyday becomes sublime. In Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, the lawn becomes a terrifying jungle. In Fantastic Voyage, the human body becomes a magnificent but monstrous space. In Alice in Wonderland, the heroine's tears become an ocean in which she nearly drowns. For King Kong, the subway is a giant snake, and the Empire State Building the tallest of all trees.

When a character shrinks, they immediately acquire a heroic character. Jack climbs the beanstalk to fight a giant, and it is his brain, not his muscles, that he must use to win the fight. Ulysses does nothing else when he defeats the Cyclops by clinging to the bellies of his sheep and telling him that the one who blinded him is named Nobody.

Other examples of stories with tiny characters or shrunken characters include Gulliver's Travels, Stuart Little, Thumbelina, The Borrowers, Tom Thumb, The Mouse and the Motorcycle, and The Incredible Shrinking Man.

Enlargement is always less interesting than shrinking because it tends to limit the possibilities for subtlety and intrigue. The monstrously large character becomes the proverbial elephant in a china shop. Everything is pure physical domination. That's why in Wonderland, Alice is only giant at the beginning of the story, when her body fills the house to the point of overflowing. The wonderful aspect of Wonderland would quickly be trampled if Alice were as large as the fifty-foot woman. This is also why the best part of Gulliver's travels to Lilliput is the first, where Gulliver is still the slave of the six-inch-tall Lilliputians. When Gulliver, as a giant, stands above the factions, he defends the abstract thesis that all conflict between nations is absurd. But in essence, the story has already stopped. Nothing can happen without Gulliver's permission.

Wonderful fantasy, Big is an apparent exception to the rule that enlargement is less interesting than shrinking. But Big is not the story of a man who becomes a giant among small people. Big is another example of a man becoming small, or more precisely, a child in a man's body. All the charm of the story comes from the character played by Tom Hanks, who has the appearance of an adult but retains the personality, spirit, and enthusiasm of a little boy.

Passages between worlds

If your story's arena includes at least two sub-worlds, you have the opportunity to use an excellent technique, the passage between worlds. Passages generally appear when two sub-worlds are extremely different. This technique is most often used in fantasy when a character must move from the everyday world to the fantastic world. Classic examples of passages include the rabbit hole, the keyhole, and the mirror (Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass), the cyclone (The Wizard of Oz), the wardrobe (The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe), the painting and the chimney (Mary Poppins), the computer screen (Tron), and the television set (Pleasantville, Poltergeist).

The passage fulfills two main functions in the story. First, it literally sends your character from one place to another. Then, and more importantly, it acts as a kind of decompression chamber that allows the audience to transition from realism to fantasy. It explains to the audience that the rules of the story universe are about to change radically. It's a bit like saying, "Relax. Don't try to apply your normal conception of reality to what you're about to see." And this is essential in the highly symbolic and allegorical form that is fantasy, as its underlying themes are based on the importance of looking at life with fresh eyes and finding new possibilities in the most ordinary things.

Ideally, the character should move slowly through the passage. A passage is a universe in its own right. Your passage must therefore be filled with things and characters that are both foreign and inherent to your story. Let your character linger there. Your audience will thank you. The passage from one universe to another is one of the most popular narrative techniques. If you manage to create a unique passage, you will have already accomplished half the journey to success.

Technology (tools)

Tools are extensions of the human form that multiply what we are capable of. They are a fundamental way for characters to connect with the world. Every tool is a part of the identity of the character who uses it and reveals not only how their personal power has been magnified but also their abilities to manipulate the world and maneuver within it.

Technology is very useful in genres that emphasize the story universe the most, such as science fiction and fantasy, and in some highly ambitious stories that place the hero within a vast social system. As for science fiction, since you, the author, create the world, the specific technology you invent must highlight the elements of the human condition that concern you the most. And since all great science fiction stories deal with the author's vision of universal evolution, the relationship between humans and technology is always crucial. In fantasy, a tool such as a magic wand is a symbol of the character's self-mastery and an indication of the good or bad use they make of their knowledge.

In stories where characters are trapped by a system, tools symbolize how that system exerts its power. This is particularly true in stories of modernization, where an entire society moves to a more complex and advanced stage from a technological standpoint. The Magnificent Ambersons, for example, presents the consequences of the automobile breakthrough. In Cinema Paradiso, the cinema is demolished to make way for a parking lot. In the classic anti-western The Wild Bunch, set in the last days of the American frontier, aging cowboys discover the first automobiles and machine guns. In Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, another great anti-western, there is an extraordinary scene where an imaginative bicycle salesman makes a series of sales pitches to people hesitant to join his group.

But tools can also be useful in story forms that do not seek to explore the world as a whole. Action stories, for example, always emphasize the hero's ability to transform everyday objects into weapons or use them to defeat their enemies. In drama, tools are everyday objects so common that they are almost invisible. And yet, technology (or sometimes its absence) also helps define the character and their place in the world. In Death of a Salesman, Willy Loman brings home a $70 commission but owes $16, which he leaves on the refrigerator. His son Happy gives him $50 at Christmas, but he needs $97 to repair the water heater, and he has postponed the car's maintenance. Willy is always "bogged down in the machine."

CONNECTING THE UNIVERSE TO THE HERO'S GENERAL DEVELOPMENT

The first step in building your story's world is to identify the key visual oppositions based on the characters and their values. The second step is to examine the endpoints of your hero's development.

This process is similar to the one we used for character creation. We start by sketching a network of characters because each character, through contrast and similarity, helps define the others. Then we focus on the hero. We examine all their possibilities for transformation, starting with the endpoint (the realization) and then going back to the beginning (weakness and need, desire), before filling in all the structural steps between these two points. We proceed this way because every story is a learning journey undertaken by the hero, and as an author, you must know the end of this journey before taking the first step.

To detail the story universe, simply reproduce the same process. We have already discussed some of the most important visual oppositions of the story universe when we studied the character network. We must now focus on the hero's general transformation to define what the world will look like at the beginning and end of the story.

In the vast majority of stories, the hero's general transformation corresponds to a passage from enslavement to freedom. If this is the case in your story, the visual world will probably also need to move from enslavement to freedom. Here's how the hero's and the universe's general evolutions correspond to each other:

If a character is enslaved, it is primarily due to a psychological and moral weakness. If a universe is enslaving (or liberating), it is because of the links between its three major elements—territory (natural setting), populations (man-made spaces), and technology (tools)—and their impact on the hero. It is the unique way you combine these elements that will define the nature of the universe you create.

– Beginning (enslavement): When the relationship between territory, populations, and tools is unbalanced, populations think only of their own survival, reduced to animals fighting for scarce resources or cogs entirely devoted to the smooth functioning of the great machine. It is a world of enslavement, even a dystopia, or hell on earth.

– End (freedom): When the relationship between territory, populations, and tools finds a balance (which you must define), there is a community where individuals can become who they are while being supported by others. It is a world of freedom, even a utopia, or paradise on earth.

In addition to enslavement and dystopia, freedom and utopia, there is another type of world that can be created for the beginning or end of a story: the apparent utopia. This universe looks perfect, but the perfection is just a facade. Beneath the surface, it is actually corrupt, rotten, and enslaving. Everyone tries to put on a good face to hide a moral or psychological disaster. This technique is used at the beginning of L.A. Confidential and Blue Velvet.

The important thing when creating these different types of universes is to connect them to your hero. In the vast majority of stories, there is a direct relationship between the hero and their world. An enslaved hero, for example, lives in a world of enslavement. And when they free themselves, they often create a world of freedom.

KEY POINT: In most stories, the world is a physical expression of your hero's personality and how it develops.

With this technique, the world helps you define your main character through the story's structure. It reveals the hero's needs, values, desires (both good and bad), and the obstacles they must face. And since in the vast majority of stories, the hero is initially, in some way, enslaved, you must focus on enslavement.

KEY POINT: Always ask yourself how the world of enslavement is an expression of your hero's major weakness. This world must embody, highlight, or accentuate your hero's weakness, or even represent it in its worst possible form.

Detective stories and thrillers, for example, often create a close connection between the hero's weakness—when it exists—and the city's underworld, the world of enslavement where the hero operates.

VERTIGO

(novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, screenplay by Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor, 1958)

The world of Vertigo highlights the hero's psychological weakness in the opening scene. While pursuing a criminal on the rooftops of San Francisco, Scottie slips and hangs by his fingertips five stories above the ground. He looks down and is seized by vertigo. His partner falls and dies trying to save him, causing a guilt in Scottie that will haunt him for the rest of the story. The storytelling technique that highlights the hero's weakness repeats a little later when vertigo prevents Scottie from climbing a tower to stop the woman he loves from committing suicide. This technique is indeed the main strength of Vertigo's story: the murderer uses the detective's own weakness—vertigo—to get away with impunity.

Creating a world of enslavement to express or accentuate the hero's weakness is also useful for drama or melodrama.

SUNSET BOULEVARD

(Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder, and D. M. Marshman Jr, 1950)

In Sunset Boulevard, the hero's weakness is his penchant for money and the good things in life. And of course, he quickly finds himself in a dilapidated mansion with an aging movie star, ready to spend money on him on the sole condition that he fulfills all her desires. Like vampires, the star and her mansion feed on the hero and regain their youth while he sinks into a gilded enslavement.

A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE

(Tennessee Williams, 1947)

A Streetcar Named Desire offers a perfect example of how the world of enslavement can, at the beginning of a story, express the hero's major weakness. Blanche is a fragile and delusional woman seeking refuge in an imaginary world, a world of romance and pretty things. But she finds herself trapped in a cramped, stiflingly hot apartment with her sister and her brutal brother-in-law. Instead of giving her the illusion of romance, this hell, and its simian king, Stanley, will press on her until she cracks and collapses.

CASABLANCA

(play, Everybody Comes to Rick’s, by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, screenplay by Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein, and Howard Koch, 1942)

Casablanca is a love story whose initial world, a world of enslavement, constantly highlights Rick's weakness. Every corner of his fabulous bar, the "Café Américain," reminds him of the love he lost in the romantic city of Paris. This club is also a place where business is conducted, possible only because Rick bribes a corrupt French police captain. All the magnificent objects in this bar tend to remind Rick that he has fallen deep into cynicism and self-centeredness while the world desperately cries out for leaders.

Fantasy is another story form where the correspondence between the world of enslavement and the hero's weakness plays an important role. At the beginning of all good fantasies, the hero is situated in a trivial world where their psychological and moral weakness originates. It is because of this weakness that the hero is unable to see the true potential of the place where they live, nor their own, and it is what drives them to explore the fantastic world.

FIELD OF DREAMS

(novel, Shoeless Joe, by W. P. Kinsella, screenplay by Phil Alden Robinson, 1989)
INTO THE DREAM

In "Field of Dreams," the hero, Ray, lives on a farm in Iowa near a town that wants to ban gambling. He builds a baseball field on his property, despite other farmers thinking he's crazy and his brother-in-law wanting to capitalize on the farm's practical and monetary value. Ray's need is to do something he's passionate about and to accept his father's illness. The construction of this baseball field—which will bring the ghost of baseball star Shoeless Joe Jackson—creates a utopian world that allows Ray to experience one last great moment of communion with his father.

MARY POPPINS

(books by P. L. Travers, screenplay by Bill Walsh and Don Da Gradi, 1964)

In "Mary Poppins," the home is a restrictive place governed by a father very attached to rules—his god is a clock. The apparent main character, Mary Poppins, is what we call a traveling angel, "practically perfect in every way." Therefore, she has no weaknesses. She is actually the agent who reveals to others their true potential, as well as the negative potential of their world of servitude. The children are rebellious in a self-destructive way and have no idea of the wonderful world of enchantment just beyond their door in London, as well as in their own minds.

The father, who is the main adversary, has an even greater weakness than his children. He sees the world as a workplace, and although he doesn't enter the worlds of fantasy, he benefits from his children's stays there and the presence of the magical nanny. In the end, the father's workplace world becomes a place where he can fly a kite with his children.

Among other traveling angel comedies that present a similar link between the hero and the world of servitude are "Crocodile Dundee"; "The Music Man"; "Amélie"; "Chocolat"; "Good Morning, Vietnam" and "Stop the World, I Want to Get Off."

The Parallel Development of the Story's Universe and the Hero

You'll notice that so far, all the major elements of the story—the premise, the guiding principle, the seven steps, the characters, and the moral debate—correspond and maintain links with each other, creating an organic unity with a very rich texture where everything works together. This is the orchestration that is so essential to the success of storytelling.

At the beginning of the story, all these elements are woven together and express the same thing. The hero lives (usually) in a world of servitude that highlights, amplifies, or exacerbates his major weakness. He then faces the adversary most capable of exploiting this weakness. In Chapter 8, you'll see that another element of the beginning, the "specter," can also express the hero's weakness.

The connection between the hero and his universe begins with the hero's servitude and continues throughout the character's arc. In most stories, as the hero is an expression of the world and the world an expression of the hero, they both develop together. And if the hero doesn't change, as in most of Chekhov's works, the world doesn't change either.

Let's now study some classic examples of transformations, contrasts, or non-transformations of the hero and his world throughout the story.

Hero: From servitude to freedom through even worse servitude

World: From servitude to freedom through even worse servitude

The hero begins the story in a world of servitude. He fights to achieve his goal and falls throughout the story's progression. Then, through awareness, he fulfills his need and becomes free in a world that also liberates thanks to his actions.

This pattern is found in episodes 4 to 6 of "Star Wars," in "The Lord of the Rings," "The Verdict," "The Lion King," "The Shawshank Redemption," "Life is Beautiful," and "David Copperfield."

Hero: From servitude to death or even worse servitude

World: From servitude to death or even worse servitude

At the beginning of stories of this type, the main character is enslaved by his own weakness or by a world that oppresses him. Because of the cancer that gnaws at the hero's soul, the world that depends on him is corrupted. As he seeks to achieve the goal, the hero has a negative awareness that destroys him and the world that relied on him. Or he is crushed by a world of servitude that he is unable to understand.

Among stories of this type are "Oedipus Rex," "Death of a Salesman," "A Streetcar Named Desire," "The Conversation," "The Conformist," "Sunset Boulevard," "Three Sisters," "The Cherry Orchard," and "Heart of Darkness."

Hero: From servitude to death or even worse servitude

World: From servitude to freedom through even worse servitude

With this approach, used in some tragedies, the connection between the hero and the world is broken at the end of the story. The hero has an awareness, but it comes too late to free him. However, before dying or falling, he makes a sacrifice that frees the world after his departure.

This pattern is found in "Hamlet," "The Seven Samurai," and "A Tale of Two Cities."

Hero: From servitude to death or even worse servitude through temporary freedom

World: From servitude to death or even worse servitude through temporary freedom

This technique involves bringing the hero into a sub-world of freedom towards the middle of the story. It is the world in which the character should live if he realized the true potential of his self. But because he fails to do so or because he discovers the rightness of his world too late, the hero ends up destroyed.

This sequence is reproduced in "The Wild Bunch," "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre," "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," and "Dances with Wolves."

Hero: From freedom to servitude or death

World: From freedom to servitude or death

Stories of this type begin in a utopian world where the main character is happy but vulnerable to attack or change. The hero's flaw, or the arrival of a new character, which alters the balance of social forces, causes the decline of the main character and his world until the final fall.

This pattern is found in "King Lear," "How Green Was My Valley," and the Arthurian stories such as "Le Morte d'Arthur" and "Excalibur."

Hero: From freedom to freedom through servitude

World: From freedom to freedom through servitude

Again, the hero begins the story in a world of freedom. An attack then occurs from outside or within the family. The hero and his world decline, but the hero eventually overcomes the problem and creates an even stronger utopia.

This approach is used in "Meet Me in St. Louis," "Amarcord," and, to a lesser extent, "Cinema Paradiso."

Hero: From apparent freedom to true freedom through total servitude

World: From apparent freedom to true freedom through total servitude

At the beginning of stories of this type, the world seems to be a true utopia. But it is actually an extremely hierarchical and corrupt place. The characters fight cruelly to win, and often many of them die. The hero eventually overcomes the corruption and creates a fairer society. Or he is simply the last survivor.

"L.A. Confidential," "Jurassic Park," "The Magnificent Ambersons," and "Blue Velvet" are good examples of this type of story.

A brilliant variant of this pattern is found in "Goodfellas," a story that combines two genres: gangster film and black comedy. The script moves from the apparent freedom of the gangster community to total servitude for the hero and death for all his friends.

THE TIME OF THE STORY'S UNIVERSE

Now that the story's universe is connected to the hero, we must study how this world itself can develop. Time is the fourth major element—after natural settings, man-made spaces, and technology—that you must use to build the world of your story.

Before studying the many ways to express time through the world—or more precisely to express the world through time—we must discuss two common mistakes made by authors regarding time.

Mistakes of the Past and the Future

The mistake that can be called the "mistake of the past" is quite common in historical fiction. The idea is that a historical fiction author depicts a different world, which has its own set of values and moral codes, and therefore, we should not judge the characters of these works by our standards.

The mistake of the past comes from the erroneous idea that a historical fiction author is first and foremost a historian. However, a storyteller always writes fiction. He uses the past as a pair of glasses through which the audience can see themselves more clearly today. It is therefore perfectly absurd not to judge characters from the past; they are shown to us only to better allow us to judge ourselves by comparing ourselves to them.

This comparison works in two ways. Negatively, it presents the dominant values of the past that continue to hurt people today. This is the case with Puritan values in Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter" and Arthur Miller's "The Crucible." Positively, the author can present past values that are still valid and to which he believes we should return. "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon," for example, glorifies duty, honor, and loyalty, values that reigned in a military outpost in 1870s America.

The mistake that can be called the "mistake of the future" is quite common in science fiction stories. Many authors think of science fiction as a prediction, an idea of what will happen in the future, what the world will really look like. This is what we saw at the end of 1983 when everyone debated the points on which George Orwell was right or wrong about 1984.

The mistake is to think that stories set in the future are about the future. They are not. When a story is set in the future, it gives its audience another pair of glasses that allows them to abstract from the present to better understand it. One of the major differences between science fiction stories and historical fiction is that stories set in the future are less about values than about the forces and choices we face today and the consequences of those choices if they are ill-advised.

The true time of a story is "natural" time. This time is linked to how the world develops and in turn favors the development of the story. Among the best techniques of natural time are the seasons, holidays, the single day, and the countdown.

The Seasons

The first technique of natural time in the story is the cycle of the seasons and the rituals that go with it. To apply this technique, you must set the story, or a particular moment in the story, in a season. The seasons, like natural settings, carry a meaning that the audience understands and that says something about the hero and the world.

When you push things further and present the change of seasons, you offer the audience a strong and detailed expression of the hero's or the world's flourishing or decline.

When you cover all four seasons, you tell the audience that you are moving from a linear story, which deals with a certain type of development, to a circular story, which deals with how things ultimately remain the same. You can present this positively or negatively. Positive circular stories generally rely on the links that unite man to the earth. Humans are animals and are happy to be so. The cycle of life, death, and rebirth is natural and worthy of celebration, and much can be learned by studying the secrets that nature reveals at its slow and steady pace. This is how Thoreau uses the seasons in "Walden."

Negative circular stories generally emphasize man's servitude—as an animal like any other—to the forces of nature. It is quite risky to use this method because it can quickly become tiresome. The weakness of many nature documentaries comes from the plot, which almost always follows the cycle of the seasons, becoming predictable and boring. An animal may give birth in spring, hunt and be hunted in summer, mate in autumn, and face food shortages in winter. But one thing is certain, this animal will give birth again in spring.

To connect the seasons to the narrative line, the classic method—executed with great finesse in "Meet Me in St. Louis" and "Amarcord"—is to establish a direct link between each of the seasons and the drama by following this pattern:

• Summer: Characters coexist in a state of vulnerability and turmoil or in a world of freedom that is susceptible to attack.

• Autumn: Characters begin their decline.

• Winter: Characters are at their lowest.

• Spring: Characters overcome their problem and rise again.

You can use these classic connections or, to avoid clichés, deliberately seek to deviate from them. A character can, for example, decline in spring and rise in winter. By altering this logical sequence, you will short-circuit the audience's expectations and tend to assert that humans, while part of nature, are not enslaved to its rules.

Holidays and Rituals

Holidays, and the rituals that mark them, can also allow you to give meaning to your story, pace it, and present its development. A ritual is a philosophy translated into a set of actions that repeats at defined intervals. Thus, any ritual is already a dramatic element in itself, comprising strong visual elements, that you can insert into your drama. Holidays expand the scope of the ritual to the nation, allowing you to express the political as well as personal and social significance of the ritual.

If you wish to use a ritual or holiday in your story, you must first examine the philosophy inherent in this ritual and determine whether you agree with it or not. You can, in your narrative, decide to support or reject this philosophy, in part or in whole.

A CHRISTMAS STORY

(screenplay by Jean Shepherd, Leigh Brown, and Bob Clark, 1983)

THE GREAT AMERICAN FOURTH OF JULY AND OTHER DISASTERS

(novel, "In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash," by Jean Shepherd, screenplay by Jean Shepherd, 1982)

Humorist Jean Shepherd is an expert at constructing stories around a holiday. He begins by combining a holiday with a narrator who remembers his family, allowing him to present the audience with a utopia of childhood through which each viewer can nestle in the real or imagined memory of a happy life within the family. The notion of a holiday creates a temporal passage that projects the viewer into his childhood. Shepherd achieves this effect through a voice-over narrator who recounts the funny things that happened each year during the holiday. His little brother, for example, who always wore a ski suit too big for him. Or his father who, every year, bought a gift that made his mother furious. There was always negotiation with the neighborhood bullies. And the time Flick got his tongue stuck on the flagpole?

Shepherd supports the philosophy of the holiday, not directly or from a religious point of view, but by pretending to mock it, laughing at the silly things people did at that time each year. But these silly things are also a source of well-being for him, especially because they happened every year and because the people, in his memory, will never grow up. That is the power of the perennial story.

When using this technique, it is important to understand the relationship between the ritual, the holiday, and the season in which this holiday occurs. Then you must orchestrate all these elements to express a transformation within the hero or the world.

HANNAH AND HER SISTERS

(Woody Allen, 1986)

"Hannah and Her Sisters" illustrates well how a holiday can be connected to a story and present a character transformation. In this film, the holiday in question is Thanksgiving. The celebration of this exclusively American holiday dates back to colonial times. Thanksgiving represents the beginnings of a nation and the formation of a community giving thanks for the fruitful harvest and the beginnings of America. But Woody Allen does not use Thanksgiving to structure the story and provide the underlying theme in the usual way. Instead of focusing on the philosophy of this holiday, Allen creates a narrative of simultaneous actions that intertwines the story of three sisters and their respective husbands or boyfriends. At the beginning of the story, there is no community, neither among the characters nor in the narrative structure. Allen creates a community through the structure by tying the three love stories together and using the Thanksgiving holiday three times.

The structure is as follows: the story begins with a Thanksgiving dinner attended by all the characters, accompanied by bad partners. Then the narrative fractures into a series of alternating montages centered on the six individuals. In the middle of the story, all the characters gather again for Thanksgiving; this time, most of them are with new partners... but they are still not the right ones. The narrative fractures again into many simultaneous threads, with the different characters engaging in their respective activities. The story ends with all the characters reunited for the third time around a Thanksgiving dinner, but this time it is a true community, each now with the right partner. The narrative and the holiday become one. These characters do not talk about Thanksgiving; they live it.

The Single Day

The single day is another temporal technique that has very specific consequences when used in a story. The first of these consequences is to create simultaneous movement while maintaining narrative dynamism. Instead of showing a single character throughout his development—the linear approach adopted by most authors—several characters are presented acting simultaneously, here and now, on this day. But the passage of hours forces the story to move forward and gives it a sense of compression.

If the story is set over twelve hours, that is, over a day or a night, a funnel effect is created. The audience understands that not only will each of the different narrative lines be resolved at the end of the twelve hours, but also that the sense of urgency will increase as the deadline approaches. "American Graffiti," "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," and "Smiles of a Summer Night" are based on this method.

If the story is set over twenty-four hours, the sense of urgency is diminished and the sense of circularity is increased. Whatever may have happened, we return to the beginning, everything becomes as before, and everything starts again. Some authors use this sense of circularity to further highlight the transformation. This technique consists of showing that if most things have remained the same, the two or three things that have changed over the twenty-four hours are the most important. This method is the hidden foundation of stories as different as Joyce's "Ulysses" or "Groundhog Day." (The TV series "24" reverses this technique by extending the twenty-four hours over an entire TV season to increase suspense and compress the plot.)

You'll notice that this circular twenty-four-hour day has dramatic consequences very similar to those of the four seasons. It is not surprising that these two techniques are often linked to comedy, a genre that tends to be circular, emphasizing society as opposed to the individual, and ending with a form of communion or marriage. Circular time techniques are also associated with myth, which is based on the circularity of space. In many myths, the hero leaves home, embarks on a journey, and returns home to discover what was already within him.

Eugene O'Neill uses the single day technique in "Long Day's Journey Into Night." But unlike Joyce's "Ulysses," which covers almost twenty-four hours and evokes the positive qualities of circularity, "Long Day's Journey Into Night" takes place over eighteen hours, starting in the morning and ending at nightfall. This tends to give the story a narrative line of decline—from hope to despair—with family members becoming increasingly detestable and the mother sinking into madness.

The second major consequence of using the single day technique is to highlight the everyday aspect of the drama being told. Rather than cutting out the dead times and showing only the big dramatic moments, all the small events and boring details that make up the life of Mr. Everyman are presented (as in "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich"). The idea of this approach is to show that drama is just as important, if not more so, for the little guy as for the king.

The Perfect Day

The perfect day is a variant of the single day. It is a temporal version of the utopian world, and as such, it is almost always used to structure a part of the story, not the story itself. The idea of the perfect day is that everything is in harmony, which limits the duration of its use, because too much time spent without conflict would be the death of the story.

The perfect day technique is generally linked to a common activity taking place over a day or a night of twelve hours. The common activity is a determining element of this technique. Associating it with a particular moment in time, such as dawn or dusk, intensifies the feeling that everything works well together because harmony is rooted in a natural rhythm. The screenwriters of "Witness" understood this very well and proved it by linking the perfect day to the construction of a barn by the Amish community and the love at first sight between the two main characters.

The Countdown
The countdown technique, or stopwatch, involves directly telling the audience that the action must be completed within a defined time frame. It is widely used in action stories (Speed), thrillers (Outbreak), crime comedies (especially those where characters plan a heist, like Ocean’s Eleven), and suicide mission stories (The Guns of Navarone, The Dirty Dozen). The advantage of the countdown is that it provides the story with intense narrative dynamism and a sustained pace… but at the expense of its texture and subtlety. The countdown also tends to create a funnel effect even faster than that of the twelve-hour day, and it is for this reason that it is often used by authors seeking to give an action story an epic scope. This technique allows for the presentation of hundreds of characters acting simultaneously in the greatest urgency without stopping the narrative dynamism. In stories of this type – The Hunt for Red October, for example – the countdown is generally associated with a point in space towards which all actors and forces must converge.

The countdown technique can also prove very effective in comedic travel stories, although it is less commonly used there. Any travel story is a fragmented zigzag narrative. The comedic travel story gives the story an even more fragmented aspect because the narrative dynamism stops at each comedic scene. Jokes and gags generally tend to divert the narrative dynamism; the story waits while a character is, in some way, humiliated or diminished. By telling the audience from the start that there is a deadline, you give them a straight line to hold onto throughout the meanders of the story. Rather than becoming impatient and wondering what will happen next, the audience relaxes and enjoys the comedic moments. This technique is used in comedic travel stories such as The Blues Brothers or Jacques Tati’s Trafic.

THE STORY UNIVERSE VIA STRUCTURE

Now that you know some of the techniques that allow the development of the story universe over time, you must connect this world to the hero's development at each stage of the story. The arc – for example, from enslavement to freedom – gives you a general idea of how the universe of your story should transform. But you must now detail this development through the structure of the story. It is the structure that allows you to express your theme without a moralizing tone. It also allows you to present the audience with a richly detailed story without losing its narrative dynamism.

But how to do it? In short, you need to create seven visual stages. Each key stage of the narrative structure tends to have a unique sub-world within the global arena of the story. You will notice the enormous advantage this gives you: the story universe gains texture while transforming alongside the hero. These stages must be linked to the other main physical elements of the world, namely natural settings, man-made spaces, technology, and time. This is how you create perfect orchestration between the world and the story.

Here are the structural stages that tend to have a unique sub-world (“apparent defeat/temporary freedom” and “meeting with death” are not part of the seven key structural stages):

• Weakness and need

• Desire

• Opponent

• Apparent defeat/temporary freedom

• Meeting with death

• Final confrontation

• Freedom or enslavement

• Weakness and need At the beginning of the story, a sub-world is presented that is a physical manifestation of the hero's weakness or fear.

• Desire This is the sub-world in which the hero expresses their goal.

• Opponent The opponent (or opponents) lives or works in a unique place that expresses their power and ability to attack the hero's weakness. This opponent's world must also be an extreme version of the hero's world of enslavement.

• Apparent defeat/temporary freedom The apparent defeat is the moment when the hero mistakenly thinks they have lost and the opponent has won (we will discuss this in more detail in chapter 8). The hero's world of apparent defeat is generally the smallest “space” at this stage of the story. The forces of defeat and enslavement literally press on the hero.

The rare heroes who die or end up enslaved at the end of the story often experience a moment of temporary freedom when most other heroes experience their apparent defeat. This moment usually takes the form of a utopia occurring in a place that would be the ideal location for the main character if only they realized it in time.

• Meeting with death During this stage (which we will also study in chapter 8), the hero travels to the Underworld or, in more modern stories, suddenly feels they are going to die. They must confront their mortality in a place that represents decline, aging, or death.

• Final confrontation The confrontation must take place in the most confined place in the entire story. The physical compression creates a kind of funnel or pressure cooker effect that allows the final conflict to gradually reach its climax, until it explodes.

• Freedom or enslavement The world completes its detailed development by becoming a place of freedom, death, or enslavement. Again, this specific place must physically represent the end of the character's maturation or decline.

Here are some examples that will help you better understand how the seven visual stages work and how they can be linked to the four major elements – natural settings, man-made spaces, technology, and time – of the story universe (indicated in italics).

STAR WARS

(George Lucas, 1977)

The global world and the arena of the story are space.

• Weakness and need, desire A desert and wild landscape. In this barren world, where it is difficult to cultivate the land, Luke feels trapped. “I’ll never get out of here,” he complains. The event that triggers Luke's desire is a hologram – a miniature – of Princess Leia calling for help.

• Opponent The Death Star. Fantasy allows the use of abstract forms and transforms them into real objects. Here, the opponent's sub-world, the Death Star, is a giant sphere. Inside, Darth Vader interrogates Princess Leia. Then the commanders of the Death Star learn that the emperor has dissolved the last remnants of the republic, and Darth Vader shows them the deadly power of the Force.

• Apparent defeat and meeting with death A trash compactor that closes with a monster underwater. Combining “apparent defeat” and “meeting with death,” screenwriter George Lucas placed the characters in water with a deadly creature beneath the surface. This room is not only the smallest space observed in the story up to this point. It is a compactor, which generates a feeling of shrinking space and time.

• Final confrontation Trench. To appear realistic, an aerial battle should take place in an open space that would allow pilots to maneuver. But Lucas understood that the best confrontations always occur in confined spaces. He decided that his hero would fly his ship into a long trench, flanked by two walls, and placed the point of culmination of the hero's desire, the weak point where the Death Star can be destroyed, at the end of the trench. And as if all this were not enough, he wanted Luke to be pursued by his main opponent, Darth Vader. Luke fires, and this tiny target becomes the point of convergence for the entire film. An epic that covers the entire universe finally converges to a single point.

• Freedom The hall of heroes. The success of the warriors is celebrated in a grand hall where all the other warriors publicly express their admiration.

THE WILD BUNCH

(original story by Walon Green and Roy N. Sickner, screenplay by Walon Green and Sam Peckinpah, 1969)

The story is based on a linear journey through desert territories, a setting that becomes increasingly arid. The story also places the characters in a society undergoing a fundamental change, moving from the world of the village to that of the city. The new technology, manifested in the form of automobiles and machine guns, has arrived, and the Bunch does not know how to adapt to this new world.

• Problem A town. The story opens with soldiers entering a town in the American Southwest. But it is a dystopian town, as the soldiers are actually outlaws, and the lawmen seeking to capture them are worse than they are. The two groups engage in a fight during which many inhabitants die. The Wild Bunch enters the town to rob the bank, but they have been betrayed by one of their members. Many of them will not make it out alive.

• Weakness and need An empty bar. After the massacre, the members of the Bunch start fighting among themselves in an empty bar until their leader, Pike, gives them an ultimatum: stick together or die. Their problem worsens when the members of the Bunch discover that the silver coins they stole from the bank are worthless.

• Desire A campfire. Lying by a campfire, Pike confides to his second-in-command, Dutch, his desire: he wants to pull off one last big job before retiring. Dutch immediately points out the emptiness of this desire by asking, “Retire to do what?” This line foreshadows the development of the entire story, which is a passage from enslavement to death through even worse enslavement.

• Temporary freedom Under the trees. Although the general development of The Wild Bunch corresponds to a passage from enslavement to death, the screenwriters used the technique of the utopian place in the middle of the story. The Bunch makes a stop in the Mexican village where one of its members was born. It is the only and unique place of conviviality in the entire story. Under the trees, children play. It is in this Arcadian place that the outcasts of the Bunch should live. But they leave, and die.

• Meeting with death A bridge. Again, this stage takes place in the smallest space observed up to this point, that is, a bridge. If the members of the Bunch manage to cross to the other side, they will be free, at least temporarily. If they do not succeed, they will die. The screenwriters added to the technique of shrinking space that of shrinking time: on the bridge, the dynamite is already lit when the members of the Bunch are stuck trying to cross.

• Final confrontation The arenas of Mapache. A confrontation so large and violent should almost inevitably take place in a vast open space. But the screenwriters of this film understood that a good confrontation could only occur between walls, in a space as restricted as possible, to achieve maximum compression. The last four members of the Bunch enter a coliseum, filled with hundreds of opponents. When the pressure cooker explodes, it is one of the greatest battles in cinema history.

• Enslavement or death A wind-swept ghost town. The story does not end with the death of the main characters. The entire town is destroyed. To increase the sense of devastation, the screenwriters added an element: the wind.

MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS

(novel by Sally Benson, screenplay by Irving Brecher and Fred F. Finklehoffe, 1944)

The general arena of the story is small-town America; it is centered on a single large house. By setting their story at the turn of the century, the screenwriters placed the characters in a society transitioning from the small town to the big city. The narrative structure is based on the four seasons and uses the classic link between changing seasons and the rise and fall of a family.

• Freedom Summer in the warm house. The opening scene presents us with a utopian world, a perfect balance between territory, populations, and technology. Horse-drawn carriages and automobiles coexist on a tree-lined avenue. A little boy rides a bicycle towards the large gabled house, and we enter it with him, starting with the warmest and most convivial of all rooms: the kitchen. The screenwriters built the sense of community – a utopia within the house – by having one of the family’s daughters sing the title song (Meet Me in St. Louis) as she climbs the stairs. This technique allows them to establish the foundations of the musical, show the audience the details of the main space of the story, and introduce most of the secondary characters.

The little girl then passes the song, like a baton in a relay, to her grandfather, who heads to another part of the house. This technique tends to reinforce the sense of community, by introducing us to more characters, but also by showing us that it is a large family, of three generations, living under the same roof. After introducing the secondary characters, the main song, and the nooks and crannies of the warm house, the screenwriters position us at the window, where we meet the heroine, Esther, who, with her lovely voice, sings the title song as she climbs the porch steps.

In harmony with the utopian world, the heroine, Esther, is happy at the beginning of the story. She has no weakness, need, or problem yet, but she is vulnerable to attack.

• Weakness and need, problem, and opponent Autumn in the terrifying house. In the next season, autumn, the warm house has taken on a terrifying air. What is certain is that the house and the season are in harmony with Halloween, the holiday that pays homage to the dead. It is also the beginning of the family’s decline, which crumbles, ironically due to the possible departure of the two marriageable daughters but also because the opponent, the father, has decided that the family should leave the small town of St. Louis to settle in the big city of New York.

The screenwriters use Halloween to extend their critique to society itself, beyond the limits of this family. The two little girls preparing to go trick-or-treating spread rumors about one of their neighbors, who, according to them, poisons cats. Later, the youngest, Tootie, falsely claims that Esther’s boyfriend abused her. This is the dark side of life in a small town, where lies and rumors can destroy anyone in an instant.

• Apparent defeat Winter in the sinister house. With winter, the family reaches its lowest point. The bags are packed, and they are about to leave. Esther sings a sad song to Tootie; she hopes for a happier Christmas the following year: “Someday, if fate allows, we’ll be together again. In the meantime, we’ll have to make do as we can.” This family community is about to disintegrate and die.

• New freedom Spring in the warm house. Like any musical, the story ends when the heroes overcome the crisis – the father decides that the family must stay in St. Louis. The family community is reborn in the spring. There are not one, but two weddings, and the family, now even larger, joyfully heads to the World’s Fair. This fair is a new sub-world, a temporary utopia and a vision of America’s future in miniature designed to show this family, and the audience, that individual prospects can exist without destroying the community, “right here, in our garden.”

IT’S A WONDERFUL LIFE

(novella, The Greatest Gift, by Philip Van Doren Stern, screenplay by Francis Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Frank Capra, 1946)

This elaborate social fantasy, which represents one of the best examples of connection between the story and its universe, is designed to allow the audience to see, and compare in great detail, two different versions of the same town. This small town is a miniature of America, and its two versions are based on different sets of values but both central to American life.

The arena is Bedford Falls, a lively small town with low-rise buildings, where you can wave to a friend passing by on the street. The Christmas holiday is one of the foundations of the story, even though it follows more the philosophy of Easter by making the “death” and rebirth of its hero the main basis of its structure.

• Weakness and need Night, Bedford Falls seen from the sky. The story begins with an omniscient narrator speaking in the third person (an angel) and is then carried by a real character, the angel Clarence. Clarence has a weakness: he does not yet have his wings. By helping George, he will be able to fulfill his need. George’s weakness and problem are that his despair has led him to the brink of suicide. This setting is designed to allow the audience to see a concise version of George’s past and to place side by side the two different versions of the town.

The sub-world of these two weaknesses, Clarence’s and George’s, is a divine vision of the arena: the town seen from the sky. The night is a physical manifestation of the religious elements of the story.

• Desire George’s warm childhood home and the deserted house where he makes a wish with Mary. After college, George lives in the domestic bustle of the family home with his father, mother, brother, and Annie, the maid. His father is a benevolent man, and there is much love between him and his son. But George is eager to leave the oppressive small town. He explains his goal to his father: “You know… what I’ve always talked to you about – building things… designing new buildings – creating modern cities.” This scene puts the structural stage of the story and the visual sub-world associated with it in conflict (in general, the sub-world corresponds to the stage). The warm house shows what a loving family can look like. But George’s intense desire to leave evokes the oppression of the small-town world, especially those controlled by tyrants.

George expresses his desire again when he returns home with Mary after falling into the pool at the dance. The two characters observe an old abandoned house on a hill – the terrifying house – which, for George, is the very symbol of all the negative aspects of small-town life. He throws a rock at it and says to Mary: “I’m going to shake the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and see the world… then I’m going to build things.” Of course, he ends up living in this house, which his wife tries to make comfortable and warm. But in his mind, this house is haunted; it is his tomb.

• Opponent The bank and Potter’s office. Henry Potter is “the richest and vilest man in the whole county.” When Clarence first sees him, driving his splendid horse-drawn carriage, he asks: “Who is that? A king?” Potter is the enemy of George and his building loan business, as these are the only two things preventing him from owning the entire town. It is from his lair, his bank, that Potter exercises his control over the town.

• Apparent defeat Bedford Falls Bridge. George experiences his apparent defeat when he must face the shame of bankruptcy due to Uncle Billy, who lost $8,000. George walks to the middle of the bridge in the snow and wind. In this narrow passageway, he decides to end his life.

• Meeting with death Pottersville, the opponent’s dystopian town. The angel Clarence shows George what the town would have been like if he had never lived and thus had not been able to counter Potter’s influence. Potter believes in business, money, power, and the enslavement of the average man. George thus begins his long journey through the Underworld of Pottersville, a perfect representation of Potter’s values.

The detail of this sub-world, written in the script, is grand, and the entire sequence takes place during George’s wandering. The main street is a lineup of bars, nightclubs, liquor stores, and pool halls resonating with dissonant jazzy music (it should be noted that this vision of the world may appeal to some of us). As stated in the script, “the wise and quiet little town has become essentially a frontier village.”

Unlike Bedford Falls, Potter’s town is devoid of a sense of community. No one recognizes George, and no one knows anyone. And, more importantly, all the secondary characters, who have been presented in great detail before, have become their worst possible version. The contrast with their previous selves is staggering but credible. Ernie, the cab driver, could live a dark version of his life. Mr. Gower, the pharmacist, could be a bum. George’s mother could be a nasty woman running a boarding house. This suggests that each of us is a range of possibilities and that the best or worst of us depends on the world we live in and the values we believe in.

George completes his journey in Pottersville – and his long meeting with death – in a cemetery, in the snow, at night. He sees his brother’s grave and narrowly escapes bullets fired by a policeman. He then returns to his starting point, the bridge, the transition place where he was about to end his life.
• Liberty Bedford Falls, the hero's utopian town. When George discovers he is alive, he experiences the intense feeling of liberation that comes from realizing the value of his own life, and even more, what he has managed to accomplish as a human being. Realizations of this kind are always very profound. In a moment of intense but enlightening irony, he happily walks down the main street of the town that, just a few hours earlier, had almost driven him to suicide. The town remains the same, but the simple street lined with trees and family businesses has become a winter wonderland. This town that George considered boring, he now sees as a utopia, because it is a community whose members care for each other. The old cold house, recently haunted and suffocating, has become warm, because it is where his family and the people who love him live, and this house is soon filled with all the secondary characters whose lives he has improved and who are now happy to return the favor.

It's a Wonderful Life offers a very close alignment between the story and its visual world. Unlike the grand sensational worlds of fantasies such as The Lord of the Rings or the "Harry Potter" series, the visual techniques of this film rely on the setting of mid-century middle-class suburban America (Big is a more recent example). It's a Wonderful Life is an excellent social fantasy. It stands on the same level as those of Twain or Dickens, from which it was indeed inspired.

It is perfectly possible to borrow from other authors, but it must be done playfully. The references should be light. Those who know them will appreciate it. Those who don't will enjoy the texture they add to the story. In It's a Wonderful Life, the angel who saves George is named Clarence, a name that recalls the ally in Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Clarence is reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer when he is called to act. And of course, the story can be considered an American version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol, mixed with a strong dose of David Copperfield.

Note that you can draw inspiration from many things, including the guiding principle of your story. But in this case, you must nevertheless modify the original idea to make it unique. Your audience will appreciate this masterstroke, even if they are not fully aware of it. It's a Wonderful Life is not the story of a grumpy old American who would see Christmas past, present, and future in New York City. It's the story of an average American whose life is laid bare and who sees what his hometown would have become if he had never been born. This is an excellent modification of the guiding principle of A Christmas Carol. You may be surprised to learn that It's a Wonderful Life did not meet with success at the time of its release. Although it is very sentimental, this social satire was perhaps too dark for the general public of its time. But over time, the excellence of the film, particularly in the way it connects characters and the universe of the narrative, has eventually won the hearts of the crowds.

SUNSET BOULEVARD

(Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder, and D. M. Marshman Jr, 1950)

Sunset Boulevard is the scathing satire of a modern kingdom whose sovereigns are movie stars. These kings and queens live and die by selling beauty. This film particularly appeals to those who know the art of storytelling—not only because its main character is the modern storyteller, a screenwriter, but also because its visual world evokes all sorts of forms of stories and references. We can only present below a few of the narrative universe techniques present in this brilliant screenplay.

The global world of the story is Hollywood, which the screenwriters depict as a kingdom populated by courtiers and a crowd of laborious serfs. By using a voice-over narrator who is himself a screenwriter, the film's authors have given themselves the opportunity to make all sorts of literary connections with the narrative universe.

• Problem An apartment in Hollywood. Screenwriter Joe Gillis, who lacks work and money, lives in a decrepit apartment. He is also part of the "factory" of Hollywood screenwriters, and "churns out two stories a week." His problems worsen when two men arrive at his home to repossess his car.

• Weakness and need, adversary The decrepit villa and its pool. Upon seeing Norma Desmond's decrepit villa—the terrifying house—for the first time, Joe thinks this secret underworld has just saved him. He will be able to hide his car, rewrite Norma's horrible script, and make a lot of money. But he has just entered the underworld of the adversary, a world from which he will never escape. This world will trap him by feeding his major weakness, greed.

Here is how Joe, the screenwriter, describes this world:

It was a big white elephantine house. The kind of building that movie lunatics had built in the Roaring Twenties. Neglected houses always look sad. And this one was more than neglected. It was like that old woman in Great Expectations, Miss Havisham, with her rotting wedding dress, and her torn veil, who held a grudge against the whole world because she had been jilted.

As he takes refuge in the guest house, Joe passes by vines and brambles, just like the Prince in Sleeping Beauty. Through the window, he observes the empty pool full of rats. Symbols of death and sleep are everywhere in this world.

• Adversary, and apparent defeat The revitalized house, Joe captured at the pool. This fairy tale world, with its haunted house, brambles, and Sleeping Beauty, is also the home of a vampire. As Joe sinks deeper into the trap of the easy life, Norma and the house come back to life. The pool is now clean and filled with water, and when Joe emerges from it, Norma, invigorated by this new blood, dries the young man she has acquired with a towel, as if he were her baby.

• Final confrontation, death Gunshots at the pool. The confrontation is brief and unbalanced: Norma shoots Joe when he tries to leave her. He falls into the pool. The vampire has finally killed him.

• Enslavement of the adversary Norma on the staircase descending into madness. With such a human adversary, Sunset Boulevard could not stop at the hero's death. The adversary literally descends into madness. She has lost all ability to distinguish dream from reality and is both her character—"Down there, they're waiting for the princess"—and an actress playing in a new Hollywood film. In front of the journalists' cameras, Norma descends the grand staircase of the "palace" in a deep sleep from which no prince will ever awaken her.

ULYSSES

(James Joyce, 1922)

One might initially feel some reluctance to use Joyce's Ulysses to study storytelling techniques, precisely because many people consider it the greatest novel of the 20th century. Its incredible complexity might seem too difficult to grasp for the mere mortal authors that we are, and its intentionally obscure references and techniques might appear as totally unsuitable models for those who wish to write popular stories in the form of film or TV scripts, novels, or plays.

Nothing could be further from the truth. While Joyce was undoubtedly, by nature, incredibly gifted for writing, he was also one of the best-trained authors in history. And if he chose to use this training to write with a complexity that you may want to avoid, it can be said that, for all sorts of legitimate reasons, the techniques he used can be universally applied to any story, regardless of its mode of expression.

Ulysses is the novelist's novel. Its second main character, Stephen, is a man striving to become a great writer. Joyce used a wider and more elaborate range of techniques than any that have ever been used in all the works ever written (except, perhaps, Joyce's Finnegans Wake, but since no one has really read it from beginning to end, it can be said that it doesn't count). In many ways, Joyce challenged other writers, as if to say: "Can you understand what I've done, and can you do it too?" Why not try to take up his challenge?

The story being a modern version of The Odyssey, it is a combination of myth, comedy, and drama. The global arena is the city of Dublin, but ironically the story is primarily set not in a house but "on the road." Like in any myth, the main hero, Leopold Bloom, embarks on a journey and returns home. But since it is a comic myth, or a "parody of an epic," no learning seems to emerge upon the hero's return.

Like many other highly elaborate stories, Ulysses takes place at the turn of the century, a time of societal change, transitioning from a small town to a big city. Dublin contains many elements of the small town, but also many elements of the big city—even the modern and oppressive city. From the start, we are plunged into the guilt that is so common in stories set in small towns: Stephen has a roommate who reproaches him for not praying at his own mother's deathbed.

The main hero, Bloom, is both the ordinary hero of the big city and the loser of the modern and oppressive big city. If Ulysses is a frustrated warrior, Bloom is a frustrated Everyman. He is Charlie Chaplin's tramp, Charles Schulz's Charlie Brown, Seinfeld's George Costanza. He is also a timid cuckold who knows his wife has a lover but does nothing to end the situation. In many ways, Joyce's narrative universe is not built on the usual combination of elements. If Dublin, for example, is an oppressive city, it is not because of overwhelming technology, nor the enslavement of the future, but because of the shackles of the past, particularly the British Empire and the Catholic Church.

In addition to using the myth of The Odyssey and societal change, Joyce built the structure of his story on the technique of the twenty-four-hour day. Circular time aligns with the circular space of myth and comedy, allowing Joyce to better define the ordinary quality of his hero and to compare and highlight the actions of a vast network of characters in the city.

Joyce also uses the twenty-four-hour day to establish the opposition of characters between his main hero and his secondary hero. The first three sections of the story, which follow the steps of the secondary hero, Stephen, take place between 8 a.m. and about noon. Then Joyce returns to the starting point, 8 a.m., to follow the steps of his main hero, Bloom. This temporal comparison constantly pushes the reader to imagine what these two men are doing at roughly the same time, and Joyce establishes a number of parallels between them to help the reader compare them.

Joyce was the creator of several techniques for depicting the secondary characters of his story's world. Since much of his theme relates to the enslaving nature of this world, he assigned many secondary characters a specific weakness and need. These are generally variations on the theme of their overly close ties to the Catholic Church, as well as the domination exerted over them by England. Or these characters have too much faith in the heroes of Ireland's past and its comfortable but ultimately debilitating stereotypes.

The network of characters in Ulysses is among the most detailed in the history of storytelling. Alongside the key fictional characters, there are a number of "real" people who lived in Dublin at the time the story takes place, that is, in 1904. And among these "real" people, there are many fictional characters already used by Joyce in other stories (particularly in his collection of short stories, Dubliners). All this tends to give the narrative universe a rich realistic texture, deeply rooted in history, as each of these real or imagined characters has a detailed character and story already defined, whether or not readers are familiar with them.

Joyce is extremely skilled at connecting key structural stages to the visual sub-worlds of the story. By modeling a modern journey through the city on Ulysses' travels, Joyce was able to create identifiable sub-worlds within an amorphous city. This technique also allowed him, despite the complexity of the story, to imbue each sub-world with the essence of one or two of the main structural stages. The reader thus feels more at ease in the ebb and flow of this great epic, and despite the complex turn of events, the psychological and moral lines of the two main characters are always highlighted.

Below is a brief summary of the major structural stages of the story, along with the sections of The Odyssey on which they are based (in parentheses) and the sub-worlds of Dublin in which they take place (in italics).

• Weakness and need, problem, adversary, and specter of Stephen (Telemachus) The Martello tower. It is 8 a.m. in an apartment in the Martello tower overlooking the beach of Dublin Bay. Stephen Dedalus is a troubled young man. He has just returned from Paris, where he was trying to become a writer, because of his mother's death. He is disoriented and doubts himself. He also feels terribly guilty for having refused to fulfill his mother's last wish, which was for him to pray for her. Like Ulysses' son, Telemachus, he wonders who his real father is and where he is. His roommate, Buck Mulligan, who appears to be his friend but is actually his enemy, reproaches him for refusing to pray for his mother.

This tower-house, which Joyce parallels with Hamlet's castle, is a prison for the sensitive Stephen, who shares it with Mulligan, the tyrant, and the haughty Englishman, Haines. Although Stephen pays the rent, he lets Mulligan borrow the apartment key.

• Weakness and need, problem, and specter of Stephen (Nestor) Deasy's school. While he wishes to become a writer, Stephen is forced to teach, for a meager salary, in a boys' school. The classroom, with its noisy and cunning students, depresses him and reminds him of the specters of his past. For the aspiring artist that Stephen is, this school is a trap.

• Weakness and need, problem, and specter of Stephen (Proteus) Sandymount beach. Stephen walks along the beach, where he sees images of birth and death, as well as a three-masted ship that reminds him of the crucifixion. He struggles to distinguish between reality and appearances, between what he must become and what others want to make of him. Again, he questions the identity of his real father.

• Weakness and need, problem, and desire of Bloom (Calypso) The kitchen and the butcher shop. At 8 a.m., Leopold Bloom is preparing breakfast for his wife, Molly, who is still asleep. Ulysses was enslaved by a woman, Calypso, for seven years. Bloom is enslaved by his wife. But it is an enslavement he has imposed on himself. Strange and isolated, Bloom has become somewhat estranged from Molly, both sexually and emotionally. He needs to be deeply accepted and loved.

In the kitchen and the butcher shop, Bloom shows his attraction to carnal pleasures, that is, cooking, women, and sex. Like Stephen, Bloom leaves his house without taking his key.

• Weakness and need, problem, and desire of Bloom (The Lotus-Eaters) A street on the way to the post office and the pharmacy. Bloom would prefer to dodge his problems or, like the Lotus-Eaters, forget them completely. Like Stephen, Bloom is passive and idle. Throughout the story, he will experience many futile desires that lead nowhere. At the post office, he regrets his correspondence with a woman named Martha, but on the other hand, he does not intend to go beyond this exchange of words and consummate this relationship. At the pharmacy, the world of medicinal drugs, Bloom's desire is to escape and overcome his loneliness.

• Adversaries, and specters (Hades) Car ride through the city streets to the cemetery. Bloom joins men he considers friends and takes part in a funeral procession. But these men treat him as a stranger. They cross paths with Blazes Boylan. Bloom knows that this man will sleep with his wife later in the day. Like Ulysses in the Underworld, Bloom remembers his father's suicide and the death of his little boy, Rudy, ten years earlier.

• Desire, and adversaries (Aeolus) Newspaper office. During one of his adventures, Ulysses is pushed by favorable winds towards his home when one of his companions opens the bag containing the contrary winds that Aeolus, the god of the wind, had carefully sealed.

Bloom, the modern traveler, sells advertising newspapers. At his office, he tries to make a sale, but just as he is about to succeed, he fails because of his boss. He is also forced to listen to a band of braggarts who seek to humiliate him and make ill-advised comments about Ireland's supposedly glorious past.

• Narrative universe, adversary, and specter (Lestrygonians) The streets of Dublin, the Burton Hotel restaurant, Davy Byrne's pub, the National Museum. This miniature odyssey (and Joyce's work contains many miniatures) is a depiction of Bloom walking through the heart of Dublin, with many details about the inhabitants and daily events of this world.

At the Burton Hotel, Bloom is disgusted by the disgusting way some patrons eat; he is forced to leave. As Bloom undertakes a journey and as he is a man who seeks to avoid confrontation, his main adversary, Boylan, is not materially present. There is no direct conflict. But Boylan is always on Bloom's mind. At Davy Byrne's pub, Bloom looks at the clock and realizes that Molly and his enemy's romantic rendezvous will take place two hours later.

At the end of this section, Bloom sees Boylan in the street. He slips into the museum to avoid speaking to him but must then pretend to be interested in the buttocks of Greek goddess statues to avoid being caught.

• Adversaries, and Stephen's realization; Bloom's adversary (Charybdis and Scylla) The National Library. At the library, a place of the mind, the theoretical and artistic Stephen presents his theories on Shakespeare to Dublin's intellectual elite. But like Bloom, Stephen is an uninvited stranger. Buck Mulligan arrives and mocks him again. Stephen has an important realization: the gap between him and Mulligan is an abyss, and he will now stop considering him a friend.

At the library, Bloom also has problems with Shakespeare and his supporters. Mulligan saw him slip into the museum and mocks the deep interest he seemed to have in the buttocks of the goddesses.

• Narrative universe (Wandering Rocks) The streets of Dublin. The Wandering Rocks section is the entirety of Ulysses' narrative universe in miniature, at the very heart of the work. Joyce takes the time to define, sometimes comically and sometimes sadly, a number of secondary characters in the city on the path of their own daily odyssey.

• Weaknesses and need, adversary, apparent defeat of Bloom (Sirens) The bar of the Ormond Hotel. Like the sirens who seduce sailors and lead them to death by singing, two barmaids tease Bloom at the bar of the Ormond Hotel. The sentimental Irish songs he hears there hurt him because they remind him of his lost son and his problems with Molly. Bloom knows the exact moment when Blazes Boylan will enter his home, and he knows it is approaching. Bloom has reached the lowest point of his fall, highlighting his loneliness and deep sense of alienation.

• Adversary (Cyclops) Barney Kiernan's pub. In Barney Kiernan's pub, Bloom stands up to the "Citizen," an Irish nationalist. Ironically, Bloom knows that at this very moment, Boylan, his main adversary, is sleeping with his wife. But even during this short phase, one of the most heroic in the story, Bloom struggles to hide his weaknesses. He comes across as a "Mr. Know-it-all," an annoying braggart giving lessons.

The bar where Bloom faces one of his greatest adversaries, the "Citizen," resembles a cave. And as the section progresses, this place seems increasingly dark, violent, and filled with hatred.

• Adversary, and narrative dynamism (Nausicaa) Sandymount beach. On the very beach where Stephen walked a few hours earlier, Bloom sees a pretty woman whose physical charms tempt him so much that he ends up masturbating. But this is just another false ally, and this moment is just another digression, a diversion designed to prevent Bloom from reconnecting with his wife.

• Narrative dynamism and Bloom's realization; Stephen's adversary (Helios' herds) The maternity ward of the National Hospital, Burke's pub, the streets of Dublin. Bloom goes to the hospital to see Mrs. Purefoy, who has been trying to give birth to her baby for three days.

Stephen has been drinking with friends, and at Burke's pub, he continues to waste his money buying drinks he can't afford. He fights with Mulligan, injures his hand, and then goes to a brothel.

Bloom begins to take an interest in Stephen and decides to stay with him to watch over him. Bloom, a passive and idle man, who had so far been driven only by small desires mostly unfulfilled, now has a true narrative dynamism, which is to find a son. It will be Stephen, the son of his friend.
• Adversary, awareness, and moral decision of Stephen; narrative dynamism and moral decision of Bloom (Circe) The brothel. In the Circe section (which corresponds to the Odyssey where men are turned into pigs), Stephen, drunk, enters a brothel. His mother appears to him in a hallucination and tries to increase his guilt to make him return to the church. Stephen refuses this way of life and breaks a chandelier with his cane (his sword), finally freeing himself from the past that has held him prisoner for so long.

Bloom enters the brothel to fetch Stephen with intense determination. He defends Stephen against the madam, Bella Cohen, who tries to swindle the young man by demanding exorbitant compensation for the chandelier. Ironically, it is by relying on blackmail that Bloom accomplishes his most moral action of the day: he threatens Bella to publicly reveal that she used prostitution to send her son to Oxford.

• Limited awareness, and second moral decision of both men (Eumaeus) The Fitzharris café. The two men head to a small café. Since his awareness at the brothel, Stephen knows what he must do with his future. He lends money to a man and tells him that his teaching position will soon be available.

In the café, Bloom and Stephen have a long discussion on many subjects. But even if they experience a moment of communion, they are ultimately too different for their friendship to survive the night. Bloom is too practical, too philistine for Stephen's extremely artistic and theoretical personality.

Bloom's narrative dynamism changes again as he wonders whether he is capable of returning to Molly, of going back home. Although he fears his wife's anger, he decides to take Stephen with him: "You can lean on me," he tells him. If Ulysses is more complex psychologically and morally than most other stories, it is partly because Bloom's moral decision is not entirely altruistic. Bloom thinks Stephen can help him write an advertisement. He also believes the young man can provide him with material for a story he wants to write and that he can benefit from his excess sensitivity.

• Thematic revelation (Ithaca) Bloom's kitchen and bedroom. The new "father" and "son" share another moment of communion while drinking chocolate in Bloom's kitchen, the very place where the "enslaved" Bloom of the previous morning was preparing Molly's breakfast. Stephen goes home, and Bloom goes to bed. Using a technique borrowed from catechism of questions and answers to tell the story, Joyce elevates Ulysses above its few characters, towards a cosmic perspective, a thematic revelation, just as he did at the end of his short story The Dead. Although the two men have experienced a short but intense moment of communion, when Stephen leaves, Bloom feels "the cold of interstellar space."

• Weakness and need, problem, partial awareness, and moral decision of Molly (Penelope) Bloom and Molly's bed. In her bed, Molly recounts the story of Ulysses from her point of view, but her journey takes place only in her mind. She expresses her deep loneliness and her feeling of being unloved by her husband. She is also fully aware of Bloom's many weaknesses and needs. In the marital bed, while her husband is now beside her (though head-to-foot), she recalls the affair she had with Blazes Boylan earlier in the day.

But ultimately, Molly is the woman of "yes." The feeling that Bloom and Molly's love can be reborn comes from the fact that she considers preparing her husband's breakfast the next morning and serving him eggs. She also remembers Bloom when, deeply in love, she agreed to marry him and made him a "caraway seed cake." In this great circular journey that ends with a return home, there is a sense that a "remarriage" between Bloom and Molly is possible.
The foundations of this goal are established when Harry and the other first-year students gather in the Great Hall, where they learn the school rules and are sorted into one of the four houses by the Sorting Hat. You will notice that this scene brings together all the episodes of a myth, unfolding over an amorphous school year, and places them on a single, measurable line. The line of desire begins in the Great Hall where all the students are gathered, and it ends in this same hall, where all the students applaud Harry and his friends who have enabled their house to win the victory.

3. Line of desire for the second half of the story: Solve the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone under the trapdoor.

It is the desire to win the school cup that guides the entire school year. But many other episodic matters must be resolved, especially since this novel is the first in a series. Rowling must introduce many characters, explain the laws of magic, and provide many details to the world of her story, particularly by explaining the rules of Quidditch. A second, more specific desire thus becomes necessary.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione accidentally find themselves on the forbidden floor and discover the trapdoor guarded by the three-headed dog, they come to the desire that will allow this complex story to converge to a precise point. The Philosopher's Stone then becomes a detective story, the form that undoubtedly has the clearest and strongest backbone of all.

• Opponents The suburban house, the classrooms, the stadium, the toilets. Harry must face his first opponents, his uncle, Vernon, his aunt, Petunia, and his cousin, Dudley, in his own home. Like Cinderella, he must do all the chores, and he is forced to live in a tiny room under the stairs. Harry's recurring opponent is Draco Malfoy, with whom he competes in several of his classes. As a member of Gryffindor house, Harry must beat Draco's house, Slytherin, in the Quidditch match held in the stadium. Harry and his friends fight against the giant troll in the girls' toilets.

• Opponent, and apparent defeat The Forbidden Forest. Lord Voldemort is Harry's long-term opponent. Hidden behind the scenes, he is the most powerful of all. Rowling, in this first novel of a series of seven, had to face a difficult narrative problem to solve. Since she had to maintain this opposition over seven books, and since Harry was only eleven years old in the first of them, Voldemort had to start the story in a very weakened state. Thus, in the Philosopher's Stone, Voldemort struggles to stay alive and must use the mind and body of Professor Quirrell.

But Voldemort and his underworlds remain dangerous. The Forbidden Forest is filled with deadly plants and animals, and Harry and the other students can easily get lost there. Harry enters the terrifying forest at night and comes across the vampiric Lord Voldemort drinking the blood of a unicorn. Despite his weakened state, Voldemort is powerful enough to kill. Harry will only be saved by the last-minute intervention of a centaur.

• Opponent, and confrontation The Underworld of Hogwarts (trapdoor, Devil's Snare, enclosed room). Harry, Ron, and Hermione go to the third floor to find the Philosopher's Stone. But after defeating the three-headed dog (which evokes Cerberus, the dog of Hades), they fall into the trapdoor and must fight against the deadly roots of the Devil's Snare. They are in the Underworld of Hogwarts, Voldemort's other underworld. And they must win the violent confrontation of the wizard's chess game, abstract but deadly.

Harry's confrontation with Voldemort takes place in a closed room – a confined space. The room is located at the top of a long flight of stairs, giving the impression that it is at the base of a whirlwind.

Harry faces Voldemort and Professor Quirrell alone, and as he tries to escape, Quirrell encircles him with a ring of fire. Voldemort attacks Harry's major weakness – his desire to live with his parents, whom he never knew – by promising the young boy to bring his family back to life if he gives him the stone.

• Realization The burning room, the infirmary. Under the extreme attacks of Voldemort and Professor Quirrell, Harry takes a stand for good. As he regains strength in the infirmary, Professor Dumbledore tells him that his body is literally imbued with love and protected by love. His skin burned the evil Quirrell and killed him thanks to the love his mother showed when she sacrificed her life to save his.

• New balance The station. With the school year over, the students are preparing to return to the ordinary world. But Harry is now armed with a photo album that Hagrid gave him, showing him in the loving arms of his parents, whom he never knew.
Mario Puzo connected his hero to God, but with the aim of highlighting a very different aspect of the divine. Puzo's God is the Father who controls his world and dispenses justice. But he is a vengeful god. He is a man-god with dictatorial power beyond the reach of ordinary mortals. Puzo also created a symbolic opposition within this character by establishing a link between God and the devil. The parallel between the usual opposites of the sacred and the profane is a fundamental element of this character and the entire story.

THE PHILADELPHIA STORY

(play by Philip Barry, screenplay by Donald Ogden Stewart, 1940)

The writer Philip Barry connected his heroine, Tracy Lord, to aristocracy, but also to the concept of a goddess. In addition to her last name, which gives her a noble aspect, Tracy Lord has a nickname invented by her father and ex-husband: "The Bronze Goddess." These symbolic signs tend to both lower and elevate her. The story is based on the following question: Will Tracy succumb to the worst traits of "divinity"—her cold, haughty, inhuman, and ruthless side—or will she choose her better aspects—a greatness of spirit that will, ironically, allow her to become more human and benevolent?

Divine heroes can also be found in The Matrix (Neo = Jesus), Cool Hand Luke (Luke = Jesus), and A Tale of Two Cities (Sydney Carton = Jesus).

ANIMAL SYMBOLISM

A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE

(Tennessee Williams, 1947)

In A Streetcar Named Desire, Tennessee Williams identifies his characters with animals, which tends to demean them, but also shows that their behavior is driven by biological laws. Stanley is compared to a pig, a bull, a monkey, a dog, and a wolf to highlight his essentially greedy, brutal, and masculine nature. Blanche evokes a moth, a bird, fragile and frightened. Throughout the story, Williams repeats these symbols in various forms. And ultimately, the wolf ends up devouring the bird.

BATMAN, SPIDER-MAN, TARZAN, CROCODILE DUNDEE

Comics can be considered modern versions of myths. It is therefore not surprising that their characters are identified with animals from the start. It is the most metaphorical and "biggest" symbol one can find. The name, physique, and clothing of Batman, Spider-Man, and Tarzan, the ape-man, all tend to draw attention to the connection between these characters and the animals they are associated with. These characters do not merely have certain traits reminiscent of animal behavior that subtly but powerfully affect them, like Stanley Kowalski. They are animal men. Fundamentally divided characters, half-men, half-animals. The cruelty of the natural state in which man finds himself forces them to turn to an animal to benefit from its specific powers and fight for justice. But all this comes at a cost: they must suffer from uncontrollable internal division and insurmountable alienation.

Identifying a character with an animal often results in very popular stories, as they present a form of enlargement (but not too much, to avoid making the story boring). Swinging from tree to tree (Tarzan) or from skyscraper to skyscraper (Spider-Man), or exerting power over the animal kingdom (Crocodile Dundee), are dreams deeply rooted in the human mind.

Other stories that use the symbol of the animal man include Dances with Wolves, Dracula, The Wolfman, and The Silence of the Lambs.

MECHANICAL SYMBOLISM

Connecting a man to a machine is another common way to create a symbolic character. Machine characters, or robot men, are generally endowed with mechanical, and therefore superhuman, strength, but they are also insensitive beings incapable of compassion. This technique is generally used in horror or science fiction stories, where excessive symbols are part of the form and are therefore well accepted. When good authors repeat these symbols throughout the story, they do not add details, as is done for most other symbolic characters. They create an inversion. At the end of the story, the machine man turns out to be the most human of all the characters, while the human character has acted like an animal or a machine.

FRANKENSTEIN OR THE MODERN PROMETHEUS

(novel by Mary Shelley, 1818, play by Peggy Webling, screenplay by John L. Balderston and Francis Edward Faragoh, 1931)

The first to connect a character and a machine was Mary Shelley with Frankenstein. Her human character, at the beginning of the story, is Dr. Frankenstein. But this man is quickly elevated to the status of a god when he decides to create life. And he will create the machine man, the monster who, being constructed from different parts, lacks the fluidity of movement of human beings. The third protagonist, the hunchback, is the symbolic intermediary character, the subhuman excluded and considered a monster by the human community, but who nevertheless works for Dr. Frankenstein. You will notice that these characters are defined and contrasted using simple but clear types. As the story progresses, it is precisely because he is considered an inferior being that he must be chained, burned, and then made to disappear, that the monster rebels and seeks revenge on his cold and inhuman divine father.

Other stories that use the machine character technique include Blade Runner (the replicants), Terminator (Terminator), 2001: A Space Odyssey (HAL), and The Wizard of Oz (the Tin Man and the Scarecrow).

OTHER SYMBOLISM

THE SUN ALSO RISES

(Ernest Hemingway, 1926)

The Sun Also Rises is a classic example of creating a symbolic character without using metaphorical character types, god, animal, or machine. Hemingway created a symbolic opposition within his hero Jake Barnes by presenting him as an integral, strong, and confident man, but who became impotent due to a war injury. The combination of strength and impotence creates a character whose main characteristic is being lost. Jake is therefore an ironic man, moving from one sensual moment to another, but unable to function at this basic level. As a man who is not a man, he is a completely realistic character who also comes to represent an entire generation of drifting men.

TECHNIQUE: THE SYMBOLIC NAME

To connect symbol and character, you can also use the technique of translating the essential characteristic of the character through their name. A master of this technique, Charles Dickens created names whose images and sounds immediately identify the essential nature of his characters. Ebenezer Scrooge, for example, is unmistakably a man who loves money and would do anything to have it. Uriah Heep may hide behind the serious facade of Uriah, but his fundamentally obsequious nature is revealed in the "Heep." We know that Tiny Tim is the quintessential good boy long before he utters the phrase: "God bless us, everyone."

Vladimir Nabokov noted that this technique had become much less frequent in post-19th-century fiction. This is probably because it risks drawing attention by being too overtly thematic.

However, when well-chosen, the symbolic name can be a wonderful tool. But it is a technique that generally works better when writing a comedy, a genre that features type characters.

Here are some characters invited to a party given by Gatsby in The Great Gatsby. Note that Fitzgerald often lists names that evoke a failed attempt to integrate into American aristocracy: Mr. and Mrs. O.R.P. Schraeder and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia; Mrs. Ulysses Swett. He then ruthlessly explains who these people really are and what they have become.

Then, from East Egg came Mr. and Mrs. Chester Becker and the Leech, as well as a man named Bunsen, whom I had known at Yale, and Dr. Webster Civet, who had nearly drowned last summer in Maine. And there were also the Hornbeam and Mr. and Mrs. Willie Voltaire. [...] From a little further on the Island came the Cheadle and Mr. and Mrs. O.R.P. Schraeder, as well as the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, the Fishguard and Mr. and Mrs. Ripley Snell. Snell had come three days before his stay in the penitentiary; dead drunk on the gravel driveway, he had his right hand crushed by Mrs. Ulysses Swett's car.

Another technique using symbolic character names involves mixing "real" characters and fictional characters, as is the case in Ragtime, The Wind and the Lion, Underworld, Carter Beats the Devil, and The Plot Against America. The historical characters in these works are in no way "real." But their legends have given them an iconic, and sometimes even divine, character in the reader's mind. They have thus become the gods and mythical heroes of a nation. Their names possess a prefabricated power, like a flag, which the author can use or not.

TECHNIQUE: SYMBOL CONNECTED TO A CHARACTER'S TRANSFORMATION

One of the most advanced techniques is to use a symbol that accompanies the character's transformation: the author chooses a symbol that represents what they want the character to become once they have undergone their transformation.

To use this technique, you must focus on the key scenes at the beginning and end of the story, then associate a symbol with the hero when you create their weakness and need. Finally, you must repeat this symbol at the moment of the character's transformation, but with slight variations from the first time you introduced it.

THE GODFATHER

(novel by Mario Puzo, screenplay by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, 1972)

This technique is brilliantly used in the film The Godfather. The opening scene shows a typical experience of what a Godfather is: a man comes to Vito Corleone to ask for justice. This scene is fundamentally a negotiation, and, in the end, the man and the Godfather have reached an agreement. The Godfather's last line before the end of the scene is: "Someday, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a service for me." This line, which sums up the negotiation, subtly suggests that a Faustian pact has just been made and that the Godfather is the devil.

The screenwriters evoked the devil symbol once again towards the end of the story, when Michael, the new Godfather, attends the baptism of his nephew while his emissaries kill the heads of the five mafia families of New York. According to the baptism ritual, the priest asks Michael: "Do you renounce Satan?" And Michael replies: "Yes, I renounce him," at the very moment he becomes Satan through his actions. Michael then promises to protect the child of whom he literally becomes the godfather, even though, as the Godfather, he will have the child's father killed right after the baptism.

This confrontation scene should normally be followed by a scene of awareness. But since Michael has become diabolical, the screenwriters deliberately deprived him of awareness. This awareness is experienced by Kay, the Godfather's wife: from the next room, Kay observes Michael's emissaries gathering around him to congratulate him on his "ascension," and then the door leading to the new king of Hell is closed in her face.

You will notice the subtlety with which the symbol is applied to the first scene: no character uses the word "devil." It is through an ingenious construction of the scene that the screenwriters attached this symbol to the hero: the word "Godfather" is spoken at the end, just before the last line that vaguely suggests a Faustian pact. And it is thanks to the subtlety with which the symbol is introduced, and not despite it, that this technique has such a strong dramatic impact on the audience.

SYMBOLIC THEMES

The next step in creating the network of symbols is to find a symbol that encompasses moral debates in their entirety. This technique tends to produce a particularly intense concentration of meaning. It is therefore highly risky. Executed without subtlety, it makes the story ridiculously moralistic.

To create a symbolic theme, you need to find an image or object that represents a series of actions that harm others in some way. Or, better yet, find an image or object that represents two series of actions—two moral sequences—that are in conflict with each other.

THE SCARLET LETTER

(Nathaniel Hawthorne, 1850)

Hawthorne is a master of the symbolic theme. The scarlet A seems at first to represent the very simple moral argument that condemns adultery. It is only as the story progresses that we understand that this symbol actually represents two opposing moral arguments: the absolute, inflexible, and hypocritical argument that publicly condemns Hester, and the much more flexible and sincere morality in which Hester and her lover have lived privately.

BEAU GESTE

(novel by Percival Christopher Wren, screenplay by Robert Carson, 1939)

This story of three brothers who enlist in the French Foreign Legion illustrates a very important rule of the symbolic theme technique: this technique works best when used through the plot. At the beginning of the story, the three brothers are children playing "King Arthur." While hiding in armor, the eldest brother hears about a family jewel, a sapphire called the "Blue Water." A few years later, he steals this jewel and joins the Foreign Legion to save his aunt's and family's reputation. The knight's armor thus comes to symbolize a noble and selfless act, the beautiful gesture at the heart of the story's theme. By embedding this symbol in the plot, the screenwriters allowed the connection between the symbol and the theme to evolve and develop throughout the story instead of striking the audience with a single brutal blow.

THE GREAT GATSBY

(F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925)

The Great Gatsby is the masterpiece of an author who was a master at attaching symbols to his themes. Fitzgerald created a network composed of three main symbols to crystallize a thematic sequence. These three symbols are the green light, the billboard in front of the wasteland, and the "fresh, green breast of the new world." The moral sequence unfolds as follows:

1. The green light represents modern America. But the original American dream has been perverted by the pursuit of material wealth and the golden girl who is only desirable because she is presented in a pretty package.

2. The billboard in front of the wasteland is the symbol of America hidden beneath the material surface, completely exhausted, and the mechanical waste created by materialistic America. The machine has devoured the garden.

3. The "fresh, green breast of the new world" represents the natural world of America, at the time of its discovery and endowed with immense potential, promising a new way of living, a second chance in the Garden of Eden.

Note that this symbolic sequence is not presented in chronological order, but in structural order. Fitzgerald introduces the "fresh, green breast of the new world" on the very last page of his novel. And this is a brilliant choice, because the rich nature and immense potential of the new world are made intensely real by the striking contrast with what men have done to this new world. And this contrast occurs at the very end of the story, after Nick's awareness. In this way, from a structural point of view, the symbol, and what it refers to, explodes in the audience's mind, like a striking thematic revelation. The technique is executed here masterfully. This is also what it means to create a work of art.

SYMBOLS OF THE STORY'S UNIVERSE

We discussed in Chapter 6 the many techniques that can be used to create the story's universe. Some of these techniques, like the miniature, are also techniques related to the symbol. In fact, the most important function of the symbol is probably to encompass an entire world, or a set of forces, in a single, easily understandable image.

Natural worlds such as the island, the mountain, the forest, and the ocean have inherent symbolic power. But if you want to amplify or modify the meaning that the audience generally associates with them, you can attach other symbols to them. For example, you can imbue these places with magical powers. This is the technique used for Prospero's island (The Tempest), Circe's island (The Odyssey), the forest in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Arden in As You Like It, the Forbidden Forest in the "Harry Potter" series, and the Lothlórien forest in The Lord of the Rings. Strictly speaking, magic is not a symbol in itself, but a set of forces of a different order on which the functioning of this world relies. That being said, creating a magical place produces the same effect as applying a symbol: concentrating meaning and charging the world with a field of forces that captures the audience's imagination.

You can create symbols that express this set of supernatural forces. Let's take the example of Moonstruck to better understand how.

MOONSTRUCK

(John Patrick Shanley, 1987)

John Patrick Shanley makes the moon a physical manifestation of the notion of destiny. This technique is particularly useful in the context of a love story, a genre where the important thing is not the individuals but the love they feel for each other. The audience must feel that it is a great love and that it would be tragic if it could not flourish and last. One way to create this feeling in the audience's mind is to show that love is necessary, that it is a matter of destiny, of forces far beyond these two mere mortals who are the main characters. To connect these characters—Loretta and Ronny—to the moon, Shanley begins, from the start of the story, by presenting Loretta as someone unlucky in love. This tends to create the feeling that higher forces are acting on her. Loretta's grandfather then explains to a group of old men that it is the moon that brings the woman to the man. At a dinner, Raymond, Loretta's uncle, recounts how the young woman's father, Cosmo, courted her mother, Rose: on a full moon night, Raymond woke up and saw through the window Cosmo, who, in the street, was watching Rose's room.

Shanley then uses the technique of cross-cutting to place the entire family under the power of the moon and establish a link between the moon and love. Several images follow one another quickly: Rose observes the full moon; Loretta and Ronny, after their first night together, go to the window to contemplate it in turn; and Raymond wakes up and tells his wife that Cosmo's moon is back. This prompts these two elderly characters, married for a long time, to make love. The sequence ends with the grandfather, and his dogs, howling at the moon hovering over the big city. The moon thus becomes the great matrix of love, bathing the entire city in its light and fairy dust.

You can also create a symbol when writing a story in which the world moves from one stage of society to another, for example from village to city. Social forces being extremely complex, creating a symbol, which tends to make these forces realistic, coherent, and understandable, can be very useful.

SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON

(book by James Warner Bellah, screenplay by Frank Nugent and Laurence Stallings, 1949)

The story presents the last working days of a captain of the American cavalry about to retire at an isolated outpost in the West around 1876. The end of the captain's professional life is paralleled with the end of the frontier (the world of villages) and the warrior values it embodied. To highlight this change, screenwriters Frank Nugent and Laurence Stallings relied on the symbol of the bison. A few days before the captain's departure, a grumpy old sergeant celebrates his own retirement in a saloon. And he says to the bartender: "That's it, the good old days are over... You don't know when the buffalo are coming back? You haven't heard about it?" But the audience knows that the buffalo will never return, nor will men like the sergeant and the captain, who belong to the "good old days."

ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST

(original story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Sergio Leone, screenplay by Sergio Leone and Sergio Donati, 1968)

This great western opera opens with the murder of a man and his children in an isolated house. The woman he has just married arrives on the scene and discovers that she is a widow and the owner of a seemingly worthless house in the middle of the American desert. As she rummages through her late husband's belongings, she discovers a toy representing a city. This city-toy is both a miniature and a symbol of the future, a model of the city the deceased was thinking of when the railroad finally arrived at his doorstep.

CINEMA PARADISO

(original story by Giuseppe Tornatore, screenplay by Giuseppe Tornatore and Vanna Paoli, 1989)

The cinema of the title is both the symbol of the entire story and the symbol of the world. It is a cocoon where people gather to experience the magic of cinema, and thus create their community. But as the small town evolves and grows, the cinema declines, deteriorates, and ends up being replaced by a parking lot. It is the death of utopia and the death of the community, which has also disintegrated. This cinema is a good illustration of the symbol's ability to concentrate meaning and move an audience to tears.

THE MATRIX

(Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski, 1999)

and

NETWORK

(Paddy Chayefsky, 1976)
When you set your story in as vast and complex a framework as a society or an institution, the symbol becomes almost indispensable if you want to reach a wide audience. Both Matrix and Network owe their success to the symbols that represent their stories and the social worlds in which they unfold. The terms "matrix" and "network" both evoke unity but also a web that can trap and enslave. These symbols tell viewers they are entering a complex world made up of many forces, some of which will remain hidden. The audience thus knows it is useless to try to understand everything immediately, that the story will contain many surprising twists.

SYMBOLIC ACTIONS

Each action is normally part of a broader sequence of actions contained within the plot. Each action is like a car of a long train embodying the competition between hero and adversary for the goal. When you make an action symbolic, you connect it to another action or object and thus give it more meaning. Note that when you make an action symbolic, you somewhat highlight it from the sequence of the plot. You draw attention to it, telling the audience: "This action is particularly important; it expresses the theme or one of the characters in miniature." So be cautious.

WUTHERING HEIGHTS

(novel by Emily Brontë, 1847, screenplay by Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht, 1939)

When Heathcliff pretends to fight the black knight for Cathy in their "castle" on the moor, he expresses their world of imaginary romance and Cathy's desire to live in a world of wealth and nobility. Heathcliff also stages, in miniature, the entire story: his confrontation against the well-born Linton for Cathy's hand.

WITNESS

(Earl W. Wallace and William Kelley, based on an original story by William Kelley, 1985)

By participating in the construction of a barn and exchanging glances with Rachel, John signals his desire to leave the violent world of the police and create a romantic bond in a peaceful community.

A TALE OF TWO CITIES

(Charles Dickens, 1859)

Like Christ on the cross, Sydney Carton sacrifices his life for another by being guillotined. "It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."

GUNGA DIN

(poem by Rudyard Kipling, story by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, screenplay by Joel Sayre and Fred Guiol, 1939)

The Indian "coolie" Gunga Din desperately wants to join the regiment of the three British soldiers he admires. During the final confrontation, when his comrade-in-arms is wounded and captured, Din blows his bugle, putting himself in mortal danger but saving the regiment from falling into a trap.

SYMBOLIC OBJECTS

Symbolic objects rarely exist alone in a story because, alone, such an object would struggle to refer to something else. However, a network of objects connected by a form of overarching principle can offer a deep and complex configuration of meaning, which usually tends to support the theme.

If you wish to create a network of symbolic objects, start by returning to the guiding principle of your story. The guiding principle is indeed the cement that can allow you to bring together the different symbolic objects to form a unified whole. And in this way, each object will not only refer to another object but also to the entire set of symbolic objects in the story.

You can create a network of symbolic objects in any story, but you should know that these networks are more easily identifiable in certain genres, namely myth, horror, and western. These genres have given birth to so many stories that their rules have been perfectly defined. And this includes objects, which have been used so often that they have become immediately identifiable metaphors. These objects are prefabricated symbols whose meaning the audience immediately understands consciously or unconsciously.

Let's now examine the networks of symbolic objects from stories that can be considered the best representatives of these highly metaphorical genres.

The Myth Symbol Network

Myth is the oldest form of story and, to this day, the most popular. The myths of ancient Greece, which are one of the pillars of Western thought, are allegorical and metaphorical, and you must understand how they work if you wish to use them as a basis for your own story.

Myth always presents two levels of being: divine and human. Do not make the classic mistake of thinking that this model corresponds solely to the Greeks' idea of how the world worked. The two levels of these stories do not serve to express belief in gods who would govern human life. The gods represent what in man allows him to achieve excellence or enlightenment. The "gods" are actually an ingenious psychological model in which a network of characters represents distinctive traits and ways of acting that can serve as models or deterrents.

In addition to this set of highly symbolic characters, myth uses a clearly imposed set of symbolic objects. When these stories were told, the audience knew that these symbols always represented something else and knew exactly what they meant. Storytellers achieved their goal by juxtaposing these key symbols throughout the story.

What is absolutely essential to understand about these metaphorical symbols is that they also represent something at the heart of the hero. Below are some of the key symbols of myth and the meaning they likely had for the ancient audience. Obviously, despite their highly metaphorical nature, these symbols do not have completely determined meanings; symbols always retain a certain ambiguity.

• Journey: The path of life

• Labyrinth: Confusion in the search for the path to enlightenment

• Garden: Harmony with the laws of nature; harmony with oneself and others

• Tree: Tree of life

• Animals (horses, birds, snakes): Models on the path to enlightenment or the Underworld

• Ladder: Steps of enlightenment

• Underworld: Unexplored region of the self, world of the dead

• Talisman (sword, bow, shield, armor): Good deed

THE ODYSSEY

(Homer)

The Odyssey is, in our view, the most artistic and influential Greek myth in the entire history of storytelling. And Homer's use of symbolic objects is one of the reasons for this success. To better understand the techniques related to symbolism in this work, we must start by returning, as always, to the characters.

The first thing to note about the characters is that Homer has moved from the powerful warrior who fights to the death (The Iliad) to the cunning warrior who seeks to return home and live. Odysseus is an excellent fighter, but he is a much better seeker, thinker (manipulator), and lover.

This change in the hero's personality leads to a change in symbolic theme: from matriarchy to patriarchy. The Odyssey is not a story in which the king must die and the mother remain; Odysseus returns and reclaims his throne. As in most great stories, the hero undergoes a transformation: when he returns home, Odysseus is the same man as at the beginning, but greater. At least, that is what his moral decision suggests: by returning home, Odysseus chooses mortality over immortality.

Among the central oppositions of symbolic characters, the most important is undoubtedly that of man vs. woman. Unlike Odysseus, who learns by traveling, Penelope stays put and learns by dreaming. She also makes decisions based on her dreams.

Homer constructs the network of symbolic objects in The Odyssey based on the characters and theme. This is why this network includes only male objects: axe, mast, oar, and bow. For the characters, each of these objects represents a version of the right path to follow and the right action to take. These symbols contrast with the tree that supports the marital bed of Odysseus and Penelope. This tree is the tree of life and represents the idea that marriage is organic: it flourishes or withers. When a man ventures too far or too long in his quest for glory (the warrior's ultimate value), marriage and life itself die.

The Horror Symbol Network

Horror is a genre based on the fear that the inhuman will enter the human community. It explores what lies beyond the boundaries of civilized life—boundaries separating the living from the dead, the rational from the irrational, the moral from the immoral—with the almost inevitable result of destruction. The horror story poses the most fundamental question of all: what is human and what is inhuman? This is why it is very often associated with religion. In America and Europe, the religious basis of horror stories is Christianity. Consequently, the network of characters and symbols in such stories is almost completely determined by Christian cosmology.

In most horror stories, the hero is passive, and the main adversary, who drives the action, is the devil or one of his emissaries. The devil is the embodiment of evil, the bad father, who will lead humans to eternal damnation if not stopped in time. In such stories, the moral debate is always reduced to its simplest binary expression: the fight of good against evil.

The symbol network therefore also begins with a binary opposition, and the visual and symbolic expression of good against evil is light against darkness. The first symbol, on the side of light, is of course the cross, which has the power to repel Satan himself. The symbols of darkness are often linked to animals. In pre-Christian myths, animals such as the horse, deer, bull, ram, and serpent were symbols of ideals that could lead man to perform a good deed and achieve a higher form of self. In Christian symbolism, these animals represent diabolical action. This is why the devil has horns. Animals such as the wolf, monkey, bat, and serpent represent the disappearance of sanctions, the passion that devours the body, and the path of evil. And these symbols exert all their power in darkness.

DRACULA

(novel by Bram Stoker, play by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston, screenplay by Garrett Fort, 1931)

The vampire Dracula, an eternal being, is the ultimate creature of the night. He lives off the blood of men he kills or poisons to make them his slaves. He sleeps in a coffin and would burn and die if exposed to sunlight.

Vampires are extremely sensual. They gaze longingly at the bare necks of their victims and eventually succumb to their intense desire to bite that neck and suck the blood. In vampire stories like Dracula, sex equals death, and the blurring of the boundary between life and death leads to a fate worse than death itself: living in endless purgatory, wandering forever in the dark night.

Dracula has the power to transform into a bat or a wolf, and he usually lives in ruins populated by rats. As a count, a member of the aristocracy, he is a typically European character. Count Dracula is the representative of an aging and corrupt aristocracy that parasitizes the rest of society.

Dracula is extremely powerful at night. But he can be stopped by someone who knows his secret. He shrinks when he sees a crucifix and burns when sprinkled with holy water.

Among other classic horror stories that play on this network of symbols are The Exorcist and The Omen. Carrie is based on the same network but reverses its meaning. There, Christian symbols are associated with bigotry and stupidity, and Carrie kills her evangelical mother by teleporting a crucifix straight into her heart.

The Western Symbol Network

The western is the last form of the great creation myths because the American frontier was the last habitable frontier on earth. This form of story is America's national myth and has been written and rewritten thousands of times. This is why its symbol network is highly metaphorical. The western is the story of millions of individuals traveling west, taming the wild and building towns. These individuals are led by a solitary warrior hero who has the power to defeat the barbarians and secure the land so that pioneers can establish their villages. Like Moses, this warrior can lead his people to the Promised Land but cannot enter it himself. He is doomed to remain single and alone, to travel forever in the wild, until death, his own or that of nature.

The western reached its peak between 1880 and 1960. This genre has therefore always dealt with a time and place that were already in the past. But it is important to remember that as a creation myth, the western has also always been a vision of the future, a stage of national development that Americans collectively wanted to embody, even if it was set in the past, and therefore could not be created for good.

The key ideas of the western are the conquest of the land, the annihilation or transformation of "inferior" or "barbaric" races, the spread of Christianity and civilization, the transformation of nature into wealth, and the creation of the American nation. The general guiding principle of the western is as follows: the entire process of human history is repeated on the blank slate of America's wild and virgin nature, thus becoming for men the last chance to regain the lost paradise.

Every national story is a religious story that relies on the definition of certain rituals and values and depends on the intensity with which people believe in it. It is therefore not surprising that such a national and religious story generates such a highly metaphorical network of symbols.

The first symbol in the western network is the rider. He is both hunter and warrior and represents the very embodiment of warrior culture. He also owes some of his distinctive signs to the English national myth of King Arthur. He is a knight by nature, an ordinary man of pure and noble character who adheres to a moral code based on courtesy and justice (known as the Code of the West).

The western hero does not wear armor, but he always carries the second great symbol of the network: his six-shooter. The six-shooter represents mechanical force; it is a "sword" of justice whose power is multiplied. Due to his code of honor and the values of his warrior culture, the cowboy never draws his weapon first. And he must always administer justice in the open street, where everyone can see him.

Like the horror story, the western is always an expression of the binary values of good and evil, signaled by the third major symbol of the network: the hat. The hero wears a white hat; the villain a black hat.

The fourth symbol of the western is the badge, which itself takes the form of another symbol, the star. The western hero is always the champion of good, sometimes at his own expense, because his violence often ostracizes him. He may temporarily join the community when he becomes an official lawman. And he enforces the law not only on the wild world outside but also on the one at the heart of each person.

The last major symbol of the western is the fence. It is always a wooden fence, thin and fragile, representing the weak control that the new civilization exerts over the wild world of nature and the savagery of human nature.

This network of symbols is used with great finesse in The Searchers, Stagecoach, Red River, and the most schematic and metaphorical of all westerns, Shane.

SHANE

(novel by Jack Schaefer, screenplay by A. B. Guthrie Jr and Jack Sher, 1953)

Due to its thematic aspect, Shane presents an easily identifiable network of symbols, but these symbols draw so much attention from viewers that they always feel like they are "watching a classic western." This is the main risk when using highly metaphorical symbols.

That being said, Shane takes the mythical form of the western and pushes it to the extreme of its logic. The story is about a mysterious stranger who, when first seen, is already on his way. He descends from the mountain on horseback, makes a stop, then returns to the mountain. This film is part of a subgenre we call "traveler angel stories." This subgenre includes some westerns, but also detective stories (the Hercule Poirot stories), comedies (Crocodile Dundee, Amélie, Chocolat, Good Morning Vietnam), and musicals (Mary Poppins, The Music Man). Traveler angel stories feature a hero who enters a community in crisis, helps its members solve problems, then leaves to help another community. In its western version, the traveler angel story features Shane, a warrior traveler angel who fights other warriors (the ranchers) to secure the land so that farmers and villagers can build their homes.

Shane also includes a highly symbolic network of characters: the angelic hero vs. the evil bandit; the farmer family head (named Joseph) vs. the cruel, single, graying rancher; the ideal woman and mother (named Marian); and the child, a boy who idolizes the man who is so skilled with a revolver. These abstract characters are endowed with almost no individual characteristics. Shane, for example, is haunted by a specter from his past related to guns, but it is never explained. The result is that the characters are at best very seductive metaphors.

All the standard symbols of the western are there, in their purest form. The revolver is crucial in all westerns. But in Shane, it is placed at the heart of the theme. The film poses a question that allows each character to be judged: do you have the courage to use this weapon? The ranchers hate the farmers because they erect fences. The farmers fight against the ranchers to build their town, their courts, and their churches. Shane wears light buckskin clothing; the evil bandit is dressed in black. The farmers buy tools and building materials in a store. But this store has a door that opens onto the saloon where the ranchers drink, fight, and kill. When in the store, Shane tries to change his life and start a family, but he gets drawn into the saloon and returns to his former life as a solitary warrior highly skilled in shooting.

All this does not mean that Shane is a bad story. If this film has a certain power, it is precisely because of its network of symbols so pure and clear. There are no frills. But it is also for this reason that the film seems schematic and its moral debate appears to be based on a one-sided moral philosophy, as is very often the case in religious stories.

TECHNIQUE: INVERTING THE SYMBOL NETWORK

The great weakness of a prefabricated metaphorical symbol network is that it is so obvious and predictable that the story becomes a kind of schema for the audience, rather than a living body. But this weakness offers an excellent opportunity. You can indeed use the audience's knowledge of the genre and its symbol network to invert the codes. This technique involves using all the symbols of the network and modifying them to give them a meaning very different from the audience's expectations. This tends to force the reader or viewer to rethink all their preconceived ideas. You can do this with any form of story whose symbols are well known. When working in a specific genre like myth, horror, or western, this is called "subverting the genre."

JOHN MCCABE

(novel by Edmund Naughton, screenplay by Robert Altman and Brian McKay, 1971)

John McCabe is an excellent film with a brilliant screenplay. Much of this success comes from the use of the technique of inverting the classic symbols of the western. This inversion arises from an extension of the traditional western theme. Instead of presenting characters who bring civilization to the wild West, John McCabe is about an entrepreneur who builds a town in the wild West but is destroyed by the business world.

The inversion of symbols begins with the main character. McCabe is a gambler and a dandy who makes his fortune by opening a brothel. It is through the money from sex that he manages to create a community in the wild. The second main character, McCabe's great love, is a madam who smokes opium.

The visual sub-worlds also invert the classic symbols. The town is not the usual geometric grid with clapboard facades set in the arid plains of the Southwest. It is a lineup of makeshift dwellings, of wood and tent, embedded in the lush and rainy forest of the Northwest. It is not a community whose members bustle under the benevolent gaze of a marshal but a fragmented and half-built town, whose inhabitants, isolated and nonchalant individuals, scrutinize all strangers with suspicion.
The key symbolic action of the western is the demonstration of strength, and this too is undermined. The classic demonstration of strength takes place in the middle of the main street, where all the town's inhabitants can observe it. The cowboy hero waits for the villain to draw first, still manages to defeat him, and reaffirms the power of good, law, and order for the entire community. In McCabe, the hero, who is anything but a lawman, is chased throughout the town by three killers during a blinding snowstorm. None of the town's inhabitants see McCabe or care that he is risking his life for the town's good. They are all busy extinguishing the flames of a fire that has broken out in a church that no one attends.

McCabe also alters the meaning of the symbolic objects of the classic western. The law does not exist. The church is empty. During the demonstration of strength, one of the killers hides behind a building and shoots McCabe with a rifle. McCabe, who, despite appearances, is not dead, retaliates by shooting the villain between the eyes with a derringer (a weapon reserved for women in classic westerns!) that he had hidden. Instead of the leather pants and wide-brimmed white hat of the cowboy, McCabe wears an East Coast suit and a bowler hat.

By choosing to undermine the genre, McCabe offers us excellent techniques for creating something new from old metaphorical symbols. It is an excellent lesson in writing and a reference in American cinema.

Examples of Symbol Networks

The best way to learn the techniques of the symbol network is to observe them in application in works. By examining these different stories, you will notice that these techniques also apply to a wide range of forms.

EXCALIBUR

(novel, Le Morte d’Arthur, by Thomas Malory, screenplay by Rospo Pallenberg and John Boorman, 1981)

If we consider the western as the national myth of the United States, then the legend of King Arthur is the national myth of England. Its power and appeal are so vast that it has influenced hundreds of thousands of other stories throughout the West. And it is for this sole reason that we, modern storytellers, must understand how its network of symbols works. As always, we will start with the symbolic characters.

King Arthur is not simply a man and not simply a king. He is the modern centaur, the metal horseman. And as such, he can be considered the first superman, the Man of Steel, the male pushed to his extreme. He is the embodiment of the warrior culture par excellence. He represents courage, strength, good deeds, and justice rendered by public combat. Ironically, despite this extreme masculinity, he respects the code of chivalry that places women on a pedestal of absolute purity. This transforms the entire female gender into a symbol divided according to the Christian binary opposition of the Madonna and the whore.

King Arthur also symbolizes the modern leader in conflict. In Camelot, he creates a perfect community based on purity, a community immediately destroyed when his wife falls in love with the best and purest of his knights. The conflict between love and duty is one of the great moral oppositions of storytelling, and King Arthur embodies it perfectly.

Arthur's ally, Merlin, is the quintessential wizard-mentor. This character is a remnant of the pre-Christian vision of magic, and as such, he represents the knowledge of the hidden forces of nature. Merlin is the ultimate artisan-artist of nature and human nature, proof that human nature finds its roots in nature itself. His spells and advice are always based on a deep understanding of the unique needs and desires of the individual he faces.

Arthur's adversaries possess a symbolic character that hundreds of writers have drawn inspiration from over the centuries. His son, Mordred, is the evil child whose very name evokes death. Mordred's ally is his mother, the fairy Morgana, an evil witch.

The knights, like Arthur, are supermen. They are above ordinary mortals not only because of their warrior talents but also because of their pure character and greatness of soul. They respect the code of chivalry and seek the Holy Grail, through which they can enter the Kingdom of God. And on their quest, they behave like the Good Samaritan by helping those in need and proving the purity of their hearts through their good deeds.

Excalibur, along with many other versions of the legend of King Arthur, is filled with symbolic worlds and objects. The first symbolic place is Camelot, the utopian community whose members have repressed their human desire for individual glory for the tranquility and happiness of all. This place takes on an even more symbolic dimension with the Round Table, which is the republic of the great. Around this table, all the knights have an equal place alongside their king.

Excalibur is the name of another determining symbolic object of the legend of King Arthur: the sword. It is the virile symbol of just action, and only the legitimate king with a pure heart can pull it from the stone and wield it to form the ideal community.

The symbols of the story of King Arthur have permeated our culture and can be found in stories as diverse as Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Hope and Glory, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Fisher King, and hundreds of American westerns. If you wish to use the symbolism of King Arthur, be sure to modify its meaning to make it original and unique to your story.

USUAL SUSPECTS

(Christopher McQuarrie, 1995)

Usual Suspects is a unique story in which the main character creates, as the story unfolds, his own symbolic character using the techniques we discussed earlier. The aptly named Verbal appears to be a small-time crook and ally, while he is actually both the hero, an expert criminal (the main adversary), and a storyteller. By telling the customs inspector what happened, he constructs a terrifying and cruel character named Keyser Söze. He attaches the symbol of the devil to this character, so much so that Keyser Söze is endowed with mythical power and the mere mention of his name is enough to strike terror. At the end of the story, the audience understands that Verbal is Keyser Söze, and that he is an expert criminal partly because he is an expert storyteller. Usual Suspects is an example of excellent storytelling supported by top-level symbol creation.

STAR WARS

(George Lucas, 1977)

If Star Wars was so popular, it is largely because this film is based on the technique of the symbolic theme. This seemingly simple fantasy adventure story has a very strong theme, concentrated in the symbol of the lightsaber. In this technologically advanced world where people travel at the speed of light, both the hero and the adversary fight with a saber. Obviously, this is not realistic. But it is realistic enough in this world for the saber to become an object capable of carrying a thematic charge. The lightsaber symbolizes the samurai's code of training and conduct that can be used for good or evil. The importance of this symbolic object and the theme it represents in the worldwide success of Star Wars cannot be overstated.

FORREST GUMP

(Novel by Winston Groom, screenplay by Eric Roth, 1994)

The authors of Forrest Gump used two objects to represent the theme of their story: the feather and the box of chocolates. At first glance, one might criticize the choice of these symbols that so obviously evoke the theme of the story. In this everyday world, a feather floats down from the sky and lands at Forrest's feet. Of course, the feather represents Forrest's freedom of spirit and his open and relaxed way of life. The box of chocolates is an even more obvious symbol. Forrest states: "My mama always said, 'Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.'" It is an openly thematic statement about the right way to behave in life connected to a metaphor.

But these two symbols attached to the themes of the story work much better than they seem at first glance. And the reasons for this success are instructive. First, Forrest Gump is a form of myth connected to a drama, and the story spans nearly forty years. Thus, like the feather, the narrative zigzags through space and time without taking an apparent direction, except for the general line of History with a capital H. Then, its hero is a simple character who thinks in the form of easy-to-remember platitudes. A "normal" character who would declare right away that life is like a box of chocolates would seem verbose. But simple Forrest is charmed by this pretty intuition, which comes from his beloved mama, and the audience is charmed with him.

ULYSSES

(James Joyce, 1922)

Joyce pushed the idea of the storyteller as both magician, symbol creator, and enigma creator further than any other author. This has advantages but also disadvantages, notably shifting the reader's reaction from emotion to pure intellect. When you present literally thousands of subtle, even obscure symbols in a thousand complex ways, you force the reader to become a scientist of storytelling or a determined literary detective willing to step back as much as possible to understand how this puzzle was constructed by some god. Like Citizen Kane (though for different reasons), Joyce's Ulysses is a story admired for its techniques but difficult to love. Let us therefore study the symbolic techniques used in it.

Symbols of the Story and Symbolic Characters

Joyce builds his network of symbolic characters by starting to superimpose the characters of The Odyssey, the story of Christ, and Hamlet onto his narrative. He adds to these references to major character networks, references to real people, and emblematic characters from Ireland's past. This strategy has a number of advantages. First, it connects the characters to the theme: Joyce attempts to create a natural or humanist religion from the actions of his characters. His ordinary characters – Bloom, Stephen, and Molly – take on a heroic, even divine aspect, not just because of their actions, but through their constant references to other characters such as Ulysses, Jesus, and Hamlet.

This technique also allows Joyce to place the characters of Ulysses within a great cultural tradition while showing them rebelling against this tradition and detaching themselves as unique individuals. This is exactly the character development line Stephen strives to follow throughout the story. Oppressed by his Catholic upbringing and England's domination over Ireland, but not seeking to destroy all spirituality, Stephen is in search of a path that could allow him to be himself and a true artist.

The other advantage of references to characters from other stories is that it provides Joyce with a signaling network of characters that extends throughout the novel. This is extremely useful when writing a story as long and complex as this one. In addition to providing a guiding principle, the character signaling allowed Joyce to assess how his main characters change throughout the story by referring to these same symbolic characters – Ulysses, Christ, Hamlet – in different ways.

Symbolic Actions and Objects

Joyce applies these same techniques of symbolic character to the objects and actions of the story. He constantly compares the actions of Bloom, Stephen, and Molly to those of Ulysses, Telemachus, and Penelope, and the effect on the reader is both heroic and ironic. Bloom defeats the Cyclops and then escapes from the dark cavern of a bar. Stephen is haunted by the ghost of his mother just like Ulysses, who meets his mother in Hades, and Hamlet, who is visited by the specter of his father. Like Penelope, Molly stays at home, but unlike the loyal Penelope, she becomes famous for her infidelity.

The symbolic objects present in Ulysses form a vast network of "sacred" things in Joyce's naturalistic and everyday "religion." Both Stephen and Bloom leave their homes without taking their keys. Stephen broke his glasses the day before. But while his physical sight is diminished, he gains the opportunity to become a visionary, to form his artist's vision during this one-day journey. An advertisement for "Plum's canned meat" – "A home without it is not really a home" – evokes the absence of the sacred act of sex between Bloom and his wife, and the harm it has caused to their home. Wielding his cane like a sword, Stephen breaks the chandelier of the brothel and frees himself from the past that holds him like a prison. Bloom considers the Catholic host as a lollipop given to believers, but he and Stephen experience a real moment of communion when they have coffee together, then a chocolate in Bloom's house.

CREATING SYMBOLS – WRITING EXERCISE NO. 6

• Story Symbol Is there a symbol that could express your premise, the key twists of your story, its central theme, or the entire structure? Review your premise, theme, and the one-sentence description of your story's universe. Then describe in one sentence the main symbols of your story.

• Symbolic Characters Determine the symbols you will attach to your hero and other characters in your story. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Consider the entire network of characters before creating the symbol for each character.

2. Start with the opposition between the hero and his main adversary.

3. Define a specific aspect of the character or an emotion you want this character to evoke in your audience.

4. Consider creating an opposition of symbols within the character.

5. Repeat the symbol, associating it with the character in question, several times throughout the story.

6. Slightly modify the details of this symbol each time it repeats in the story.

• Types of Characters Consider connecting one or more of your characters to a particular type of character, god, animal, or machine.

• Symbol of Character Transformation Is there a symbol you could connect to your hero's transformation? If so, examine the opening scenes in which you expressed your hero's weakness and need, as well as the ending scenes that correspond to his realization.

• Symbolic Theme Look for a symbol that could encompass the theme of your story. This symbol should represent a series of actions with moral consequences, or better yet, two series of moral actions that are in conflict.

• Symbolic World Determine the symbols you wish to attach to the various elements of the story's universe, i.e., natural settings, man-made spaces, technology, and time.

• Symbolic Actions Does your story have one or more actions that deserve symbolic treatment? Determine the symbol you can attach to each of them to make them stand out.

• Symbolic Objects Create a network of symbolic objects based on the guiding principle of your story. Ensure that each object aligns with the theme. Then determine the objects you wish to give more meaning to.

• Development of Symbols Make a chart and note how each of the symbols you use evolves throughout the story.

To better understand how to put these techniques into practice, let's look at The Lord of the Rings.

THE LORD OF THE RINGS

(J. R. R. Tolkien, 1954-1955)

The Lord of the Rings is nothing less than a modern cosmology and mythology of England. This story brings together myth, legend, and romance as well as references to stories and symbols from Greek and Norse mythology, Christianity, fairy tales, the legend of King Arthur, and the wandering knight. The Lord of the Rings is an allegorical story in the sense that, as Tolkien said, it can be easily applied to the modern world and era. "Allegorical" means, among other things, that the characters, worlds, actions, and objects are, by necessity, highly metaphorical. This does not mean they are not unique or created by the author. It means that these symbols are references echoing earlier symbols, often deeply embedded in the readers' minds.

• Story Symbol The story's symbol is evoked in its very title. The ring is an object of unlimited power that everyone seeks to obtain. Whoever possesses it becomes a lord with divine powers. But this lord will inevitably be destructive. The ring is a great temptation that can lead people away from their moral and happy lives. And its seductive power is endless.

• Symbolic Characters The main strength of this incredibly textured story is its rich network of symbolic characters. It is not simply man vs man, man vs animal, or man vs machine. These characters are defined and differentiated through the opposition of good and evil, by their levels of power (god, wizard, man, Hobbit), and by the species to which they belong (man, elf, dwarf, Orc, goblin, Ent, and ghost). Myth works through character types, and this is one of the reasons it presents an epic scope but little subtlety in depicting people. Here, on the contrary, with this complex and rich network of character types, Tolkien and his audience have their cake and eat it too. This is an important lesson for any author using symbolic characters, especially in stories based on myths.

In Tolkien's character oppositions, good is symbolized by Gandalf and Sam, the self-sacrificing characters; by the warrior-king Aragorn who can both heal and kill; and by those who are one with nature and have become experts in self-mastery rather than mastery over others: Galadriel and Tom Bombadil. Tolkien's hero is not the great warrior but the little "man," the Hobbit Frodo Baggins, who, through his greatness of spirit, becomes the most heroic character of all. Like Leopold Bloom in Joyce's Ulysses, Frodo is a new type of mythical hero, defined not by the strength of his weapons but by the depth of his humanity.

The adversaries are also endowed with great symbolic power. Morgoth is the original evil character who precedes this story and is part of the past Tolkien created for The Lord of the Rings. Like Mordred in the legend of King Arthur, Maugrim in The Chronicles of Narnia, and Voldemort in the "Harry Potter" series (English writers love to name their villains with names containing the syllable "mor," probably because this syllable evokes the French word "mort"), Morgoth evokes for the reader the first anti-God, Satan, and his name and actions are associated with death. Sauron is the main adversary in The Lord of the Rings; he is evil because he seeks absolute power and wishes to use it to destroy Middle-earth. Saruman is a turncoat character: a wizard sent to fight Sauron, he is corrupted by the lure of absolute power. The other adversaries – Gollum, the Nazgûl, the Orcs, Shelob the spider, and the Balrog – are different symbolic expressions of envy, hatred, violence, and destruction.

• Symbolic Theme As always in good stories (and as in any allegory), all elements are based on the thematic line and oppositions. In Tolkien, this translates into a Christian-inspired thematic structure that highlights the battle of good against evil. Evil is defined here by the taste and use of power. Good comes from caring for living things, and its highest expression is sacrifice, especially giving one's own life to save another's.

• Symbolic Worlds The visual sub-worlds of The Lord of the Rings are as rich and symbolic as its network of characters. These worlds are both natural and supernatural. And the man-made spaces themselves are imbued with the natural environment, of which they are an extension. Like the characters, these symbolic sub-worlds are placed in opposition. In the world of the forest, there is the magnificent and harmonious Lothlórien and the forest of the tree-beings that are the Ents vs the evil Mirkwood. The forest worlds, the good, are also placed in opposition to the mountain world, the residence of the forces of evil. Sauron rules from his lair on the mountain, Mordor, located behind the massive gate of Morannon (more "mor"). It is on the Misty Mountains that the caves of Moria are found, and the heroes will descend into these "Hells." Frodo crosses the Dead Marshes, a cemetery for those fallen in battle.

The "human" communities are also an expression of this natural symbolism. Just as Lothlórien is a utopia built among the trees, Rivendell is a utopia built among water and plants. The Shire, home of the Hobbits, is a village erected within an agricultural and domesticated world. These communities contrast with the mountain fortresses of Mordor, Isengard, and Helm's Deep, founded on raw power.

• Symbolic Objects The Lord of the Rings is a story based on the quest for symbolic objects and their possession, and these objects are often drawn from the earth or forged in fire. The most important of these is, of course, the One Ring that Sauron forged in the fire of a volcano, Mount Doom. This ring symbolizes the desire for false values and absolute power, and whoever wears it will inevitably and completely become evil and corrupt. There is also another circular symbol: the Eye of Sauron, which can see everything from the top of the Dark Tower and aids Sauron in his quest for the ring.
Like Excalibur, Andúril, whose name literally means "the Flame of the West," is the sword of good deeds that can only be wielded by the rightful heir to the throne. While Excalibur is embedded in a stone, Andúril was broken and must be reforged for Aragorn to defeat the forces of evil and reclaim the throne. Aragorn is an irreplaceable warrior-king thanks to his mastery of the plant Athelas, which has the power to heal. Like Achilles, Aragorn is a highly skilled fighter, but also a being in harmony with nature and a representative of life.

Of course, these are just a few of the symbols used by Tolkien in the epic The Lord of the Rings. By studying them carefully, you will learn to master most of the techniques for creating symbols.

1. The original title is One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. The French translation, almost literal, could not convey the pun on the term cuckoo, which means both "coucou," the bird, and "fool" or "crazy" (Translator's Note).

2. As in French, the term network can refer to both a web and the broadcasting stations and relays of radio or television (Translator's Note).

3. Alien primarily means "stranger," and by extension, "extraterrestrial" (Translator's Note).

4. Steerforth could be literally translated as "Straight ahead" (Translator's Note).

5. The original title is The Godfather. This term, which indeed means "godfather," is composed of two words God and father. In the English language, the godfather is therefore the father given by God. (Translator's Note).

6. Scrooge means "miser" (Translator's Note).

7. Heep means "itching powder" (Translator's Note).

8. "Little Tim" (Translator's Note).

9. "Matrix" and "Network" (Translator's Note).

10. In French in the text (Translator's Note).

The Plot

Of all the major skills essential to storytelling, the plot is the most underestimated. Most authors understand that characters and dialogue play a decisive role in the story, even if they don't always know how to write them correctly. But when they think about the plot, they just tell themselves they'll think about it at the right time—and of course, that moment never comes.

Creating the plot involves interweaving the characters and their actions throughout the story. It is therefore an eminently complex task. The plot must be extremely detailed, and yet its different parts must form a whole. A problem with just one of the plot's events can be enough to make the story collapse like a house of cards.

It's not surprising that plot creation techniques—such as the "three-act structure"—that don't take into account the story as a whole or the various detailed threads of the narrative, fail miserably. Authors who rely on the old techniques of the three-act structure always complain about having problems with the second act. This is because the techniques they use to create their plot are fundamentally flawed. The mechanical and simplistic techniques of the three-act structure fail to provide an accurate map that would show how to weave a plot to get out of the difficult middle section of the story.

If many authors underestimate the importance of the plot, it's because they have a misconception of it. Often it is believed that the plot is the same as the story or that the plot simply follows the actions of a hero seeking to achieve a goal. Or that the plot is the way the story is told.

The story is much broader than the plot. The story is composed of all the subsystems of its body—the premise, the characters, the moral debate, the universe, the symbols, the plot, the scenes, and the dialogues—that work together. The story is "a complex of multifaceted forms and meanings where the narrative line [the plot] is just one aspect among many."

The plot weaves beneath the surface the various lines of actions, or sets of events, so that the story unfolds gradually from its beginning to its end through its middle. To be more precise, the plot follows the complex dance of the hero and all his adversaries as they fight for the same goal. It combines the events and the way they are revealed to the audience.

KEY POINT: Your plot depends on how you hide and reveal information. Creating a plot is "masterfully managing suspense and mystery, artfully guiding the reader in a highly elaborate space [...] always filled with signs to decipher and threatened, until the end, with being misinterpreted."

THE ORGANIC PLOT

A plot describes a sequence of events: this happens, then that, and then that. But a simple sequence of events is not a good plot. Because there is no design, no guiding principle that tells you which events should be told and the order in which they should be. A good plot is always organic. This means in particular:

• An organic plot presents the actions that lead to the transformation of the hero, or explains why this transformation is impossible.

• Each of the events is causally correlated with the others.

• Each event is essential.

• Each action is proportionate in its length and rhythm.

• The events of the plot seem to naturally emanate from the main character, rather than being imposed on him by the author. Imposed plots seem mechanical, the workings of the story being too apparent. The characters seem emptied of their content and humanity, and look like puppets or pawns. A plot naturally emanating from the hero is not simply a plot concocted by the hero. It is a plot that is in line with his desire and his ability to develop a... plot!

• The sequence of events has a unity, gives the impression of a whole. As Edgar Allan Poe said, in a good plot "no part can be moved, under penalty of collapsing the whole."

TYPES OF PLOT

The idea of an organic plot is difficult to grasp, but much less so to apply. This is partly because creating a plot always involves a contradiction. The plot is something that is shaped by creating actions and events from nothing and then connecting them in a certain order. And yet, the events of this plot must appear as necessary steps that develop on their own.

Historically, one can say that, in general, in the plot, we have moved from emphasizing action to emphasizing understanding (action and understanding being the two "legs" that allow any story to move forward). The earliest plots, which relied on the form of myth, presented a main character undertaking a series of heroic actions encouraging the audience to imitate him. Later, the plot, relying on an expanded version of the detective story, began to present a hero to an audience who did not know what was happening or had difficulty grasping everything, his task being to determine the truth about the various events and characters.

Let's now study some of the main types of plot to understand the different means that can be implemented to create a sequence of events and an organic plan.

The Journey Plot

The first plot creation strategy comes from myth tellers, whose main technique is the journey. With this form of plot, the hero undertakes a journey during which he successively encounters a number of adversaries. After defeating them one by one, he returns home. The journey is supposed to be organic (1) because a single person creates the narrative line and (2) because the journey provides a physical manifestation of the character's transformation. Each time the hero defeats one of his adversaries, he may experience a mini-transformation. But he only experiences his great transformation (his realization) when he returns home to discover what he already had within himself; that is, what he "had in his belly."

The problem with the journey plot is that it generally fails to fully achieve its organic potential. First, the hero, most often, does not experience the slightest transformation when he defeats each of his adversaries. After each victory, he simply continues on his way. So each confrontation only repeats the same high point and gives the impression of being episodic, not organic.

The other reason the journey plot rarely becomes organic is that the hero covers so much space and time during his journey. Due to the extension and many twists of the story, the author has a hard time bringing back later the characters the hero meets in the first part of the story, and doing so naturally and credibly.

Over the years, authors, painfully aware of the inherent problems of the journey plot, have tried various techniques to solve them. In The History of Tom Jones, for example, which is a comedic travel story, Henry Fielding relies on two major structural corrections. First, at the beginning of the story, he hides the true identity of the hero, as well as that of a few other characters. This allows him, later, to return to these already familiar characters to explore them more deeply. Fielding applies the twist technique, also called the "discovery" technique, to the journey plot.

Second, Fielding brings back most of the characters present at the beginning of the story on the hero's journey by sending them on a journey themselves, whose destination is the same as Tom's. This creates a funnel effect and allows Tom to multiply encounters with the same characters throughout the story.

The difficulty of creating an organic plot using the journey appears clearly in Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Twain had the brilliant idea of the raft, a miniature floating island, on which he can place Huck, and a second recurring character, Jim. But this vehicle is too small: Huck and Jim have no recurring adversary; and simply meet a succession of strangers "on the road." Another difficulty: with his main character drifting along the Mississippi, Twain doesn't know how to bring the plot to a natural end. He therefore arbitrarily ends the journey and uses a deus ex machina to get out of it. Tom Sawyer has no reason to reappear, except to bring the plot back to its comedic roots, simply applying a nice coat of varnish before putting up the "End" sign. Even Mark Twain shouldn't be allowed to get away with that...

The Three Unities Plot

The second major strategy for creating an organic plot comes from Antiquity and Greek playwrights such as Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Their essential technique is based on what Aristotle called the unity of time, place, and action. With this technique, the story must take place in twenty-four hours, in a single location, and cover only one action, or "essential action." The plot is organic because all actions come from the hero, over a very short development time. Note that this technique solves the major problem of the journey plot by making the adversaries characters the hero knows and who are present throughout the story.

The problem with the three unities is that if the plot becomes organic, it is not consistent enough. The very short time frame limits the number and power of twists. Twists correspond to the "understanding" part of the plot (as opposed to action), and they determine the complexity level of the plot. The brevity of these stories implies that the hero knows his adversaries too well. They may have started plotting something before the story begins, but once it starts, their possibilities for concealment are limited.

Therefore, the three unities plot generally only allows enough time, adversaries, and complexity of action for one major twist. Oedipus (the world's first detective story), for example, learns that he killed his father and slept with his mother. It is undeniably a great twist. But for the plot to be consistent, it must be peppered throughout the story with multiple twists.

The Twist Plot

The third type of plot is what we can call the twist plot. With this technique, the hero usually stays in one place, but it is not necessarily as restricted as that required by the unity of place. The story can, for example, take place in a large city. And the twist plot almost always covers a longer period than that allowed by the unity of time. The story can even unfold over several years (if it spans several decades, you are probably writing a saga, a type of plot more akin to the journey plot).

The key technique of the twist plot is that the hero is familiar with his adversaries, but he and the audience are unaware of many things about them. Moreover, these adversaries excel at manipulating to get what they want. The result of this combination is a plot full of twists, or surprises, for both the hero and the audience.

Note the main difference between the journey plot and the twist plot: with the journey plot, surprise is limited because the hero quickly gets rid of many adversaries. The twist plot limits the number of adversaries and hides as much as possible about them. The twists multiply the plot by diving beneath the surface of the story.

Well executed, the twist plot is organic because the adversary is the character most capable of attacking the hero's major weakness, and the twists are the scenes where the hero and the audience learn how these attacks occurred. The hero must then overcome his weakness and change, or be destroyed.

The twist plot is very popular because it offers the maximum surprise, which delights the audience. It is also called "big plot," not only because it contains many surprises, but also because these surprises are often shocking. Although the twist plot is still extremely popular today—especially in detective stories and thrillers—it can be said that it had its heyday in the 19th century with authors such as Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers) and Dickens. Unsurprisingly, the 19th century is also the golden age of novels like Portrait of a Lady where extremely powerful villains hatch diabolical plots to achieve their ends.

Dickens was a master of the twist plot and his talent has probably never been equaled. But if Dickens is considered one of the greatest storytellers of all time, it is partly because he often combined the twist plot and the journey plot to give his story a broader dimension. Needless to say, this requires immense talent for plot creation, as these two approaches are in many ways opposed. In the journey plot, the hero encounters a wide range of society representatives but quickly leaves them behind. In the twist plot, the hero meets only a handful of people but gets to know them in depth.

The Anti-Plot

If the 19th century was the era of the super plot, the 20th century, at least in "serious" fiction, was the era of the anti-plot. In stories as different as Joyce's Ulysses, Last Year at Marienbad, L'Avventura, Waiting for Godot, The Cherry Orchard, and The Catcher in the Rye, there is a kind of disdain for the plot, as if it were a kind of magical sacrifice to be made to the audience in order to fully devote oneself to character work. As Northrop Frye said, "one can read a novel or watch a play to see 'how it feels.' But once one knows what it gives, and the charm has ceased to act, one tends to forget the continuity, the very element of the play or novel that allowed us to take part in it."

If one attempted to summarize the plot of some of these stories, it would give something like this: The Catcher in the Rye is the story of a teenager wandering around New York for two days. In The Cherry Orchard, a family arrives on their land, waits for it to be auctioned off, and leaves. L'Avventura is a detective film in which no crime is committed or solved.

I am quite sure that many 20th-century authors were not so much rebelling against the plot as against the "big" plot, whose sensational twists shocked the reader so much that they swept everything away. What I call anti-plot is rather a wide range of techniques designed by these authors to make the plot organic by having it express the subtleties of the characters. Point of view, change of narrator, branching narrative structure, and non-chronological time are techniques that play on the plot by changing the way the story is told with the ultimate goal of presenting a more complex vision of the human character.

If these techniques can give the story a fragmented aspect, they are not necessarily inorganic. Multiple points of view sometimes evoke a collage, a montage, and a dislocation of the character, but they also give a sense of vitality and produce a flow of sensations. If these experiences contribute to the development of the character and the audience's idea of the character, they can be considered organic and ultimately satisfying.

Digressions—very common in anti-plots—are a form of simultaneous actions and sometimes flashbacks. They are organic if, and only if, they come from the character himself. The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, for example, the anti-plot novel par excellence, has often been criticized for its endless digressions. What readers did not understand is that Tristram Shandy is not a story whose plot is interrupted by digressions but a story of digressions interrupted by what seems to be a main plot. The main character, Tristram, is essentially a man who digresses. Therefore, the way the story is told is a perfectly organic expression of the hero himself.

Reverse narration, like Harold Pinter's Betrayal, a play whose scenes are presented in reverse chronological order, is a variant of the anti-plot. Reverse narration tends to highlight the organic unfolding of the story by emphasizing the cause-and-effect link between scenes. This link is normally hidden beneath the surface of the story, each scene seeming to naturally follow the previous one. But if the story is told in reverse, the audience is forced to become aware of the link connecting the scenes. They understand that what just happened had to result from the previous event, which itself results from a previous event.

The Genre Plot

While "serious" authors were working to diminish the plot, popular authors, especially screenwriters and novelists, were striving to give it even more importance through genre. Genres are types of stories whose characters, themes, universes, and plots are predetermined. Genre plots are usually big plots made of twists so staggering that they sometimes completely overturn the story. But of course, these big plots lose some of their power by the very fact that they are predetermined. In a genre story, the audience generally knows what will happen, and only the details can still surprise them.

If these various genre plots seem organically connected to their main characters, it is simply because they have been written and rewritten to excess. They are thus devoid of any frills. But these genre plots lack a fundamental element of the organic plot. Indeed, they were not written specifically for their characters. They are literally generic, and therefore mechanical. In some genres, such as farce and heist stories, this mechanical aspect is pushed to the extreme, so much so that the plot comes to have the complexity and precision of a Swiss watch—but no character.

The Multiple Thread Plot

The most recent plot strategy, that of multiple threads, was first invented for novels and cinema, but really took off on TV in soap operas, starting with the flagship series Hill Street Blues. With this strategy, each story, or weekly episode, includes between three and five plot threads. Each plot thread is led by a distinct character within a group, usually an organization such as a police station, hospital, or law firm. And the author constantly switches from one thread to another, in cross-cutting. When this strategy is poorly implemented, the different threads have nothing to do with each other, and the cross-cutting is used only to force the audience's attention and speed up the story's pace. When this strategy is well implemented, each of the threads is a variation on a theme, and the transition from one thread to another creates a shock of understanding when two scenes are juxtaposed.

The multiple thread plot is clearly a much more simultaneous form of storytelling, emphasizing the group, or mini-society, and the comparison between characters. But this does not mean that this plot strategy can never be organic. The multiple approach simply changes the unit of development, shifting it from the individual hero to the group. When all the threads are variations of the same theme, the audience more easily grasps what makes our common humanity, which can be just as revealing and moving as observing the development of a single person.

CREATING AN ORGANIC PLOT
Now that you are familiar with some of the main plot strategies, the big question is: how do you create an organic plot for your characters? Here’s how to proceed:

1. Re-examine your guiding principle, which is the organic seed of your story. The plot must ultimately be the fruit of this principle, down to the smallest detail.

2. Immerse yourself again in your thematic line, that is, the moral debate you wish to establish, summarized in one sentence. The plot must also be a detailed manifestation of this line.

3. If you have created a symbolic line for your entire story, your plot, in general, should also express this line. Here, you must find how your sequence of symbols can be expressed through the actions of the hero and his adversary (the plot).

4. Determine whether or not you want to use a narrator. This choice will have a significant impact on how you tell the audience what is happening and, consequently, on the structuring of your plot.

5. Detail the narrative structure using the twenty-two structural steps of any good story (we will discuss this in a moment). This will provide you with most of the highlights (i.e., major actions or events) of your plot and will guarantee you—as much as a technique can—an organic plot.

6. Decide if you want your story to adhere to one or more genres. If so, you must add the specific highlights of these genres to your plot by placing them in the right place and modifying them so that your plot does not become predictable.

You should decide on the presence or absence of a narrator in your story before using the twenty-two building blocks to define your plot. That being said, we will proceed in reverse and start by explaining what these powerful and sophisticated tools that are the twenty-two steps of the narrative structure correspond to, as it is the simplest way to understand them.

THE TWENTY-TWO STEPS OF THE NARRATIVE STRUCTURE

The twenty-two building blocks of any great story are the essential structural steps or events for the deployment of an organic plot. We have already mentioned the seven key structural steps in Chapter 3. But these seven steps correspond to the beginning and the end of the story. The other fifteen are essentially located in the middle of the story, which is where most stories fail.

Due to its broad and detailed nature, the twenty-two-step narrative technique is the most useful of all. The steps show you how to create an organic plot, regardless of the length or genre of your story. They also constitute an indispensable set of tools for any rewriting. If these twenty-two steps are so useful, it is primarily because they never tell you what to write, as ready-made formulas or genres do. They show you the most dramatic way to tell your story to an audience. They provide you with an extremely precise map of your entire plot, allowing you to construct your story gradually, from beginning to end, avoiding the infamous "soft belly," dead and fragmented, in the middle, which causes so much trouble for many authors. Here is the list of these twenty-two steps:

1. Awareness, need, and desire

2. Ghost and story world

3. Weakness and need

4. Inciting event

5. Desire

6. Ally(ies)

7. Opponent / mystery

8. False ally

9. First revelation and decision: modification of desire and motivations

10. Plan

11. Opponent’s plan and main counterattack

12. Narrative drive

13. Attack by an ally

14. Apparent defeat

15. Second revelation and decision: obsessive drive, modification of desire and motivations

16. Revelation to the audience

17. Third revelation and decision

18. Narrow gate, Scylla and Charybdis, and meeting with death

19. Final confrontation

20. Hero’s awareness

21. Moral decision

22. New equilibrium

At first glance, you might think these steps will hinder your creativity and lead to a mechanical rather than organic story. This idea is linked to a fear that affects many writers, that of excessive planning. But writers who refuse any form of planning try to write their story as it comes to them and often end up with a big mess. Using the twenty-two steps actually avoids these two extremes and increases creativity. These steps should not be considered a ready-made formula for good writing. They should be seen as the scaffolding you need to achieve something truly creative and to ensure that everything will work as the story unfolds organically.

Similarly, it is useless to fixate on the number twenty-two. A story can have fewer than twenty-two steps. It all depends on its type and length. You should think of the story as an accordion. It is only limited in its contraction capabilities. But it must always be composed of a minimum of seven steps to remain organic. You will notice that even thirty-second commercials, when they are good, follow these seven steps.

But the longer the story, the more structural steps it requires. A short story or a sitcom, for example, must stick to the seven major steps due to the limited time allotted to the story they tell. A film, an hour-long series episode, or a short novel will have at least twenty-two steps (unless it is a multi-thread drama, in which case each thread will follow the seven steps). A long novel, with all its twists and surprises, can contain far more than twenty-two structural steps. In David Copperfield, for example, there are no fewer than sixty twists.

By studying the twenty-two steps in depth, you will see that they are actually several systems of the story body combined to weave a single narrative line. These steps blend the character network, the moral debate, the story world, and the series of events that make up the plot. They represent the detailed choreography that pits the hero against his opponents as he tries to achieve a goal and solve a more existential problem. In practice, these twenty-two steps ensure that it is indeed your hero who leads the plot.

The table below represents the twenty-two steps divided into three categories, or sub-systems of the story. Remember that each step can be the expression of several sub-systems. Narrative drive, for example, which corresponds to all the actions taken by the hero to achieve the goal, is a step that primarily belongs to the plot. But it is also a step during which the hero commits a number of immoral acts in order to win. And therefore, it also belongs to the moral debate.

The description of the twenty-two steps below will help you understand how to use them to create your plot. After each step explanation, we will illustrate our points with examples from two films, Casablanca and Tootsie. These films represent two different genres—the love story and the comedy—and were written forty years apart. Yet, their organic plots both rely on the twenty-two steps, developing gradually from their beginning to their end.

Never forget that these steps are powerful tools, but they are not set in stone. You must therefore be very flexible when using them. Every good story goes through these steps in a slightly different order than the one presented below. You must therefore find the order that best suits the plot and characters you have created yourself.

New equilibrium

1. Awareness, need, and desire

Awareness, need, and desire represent the entire transformation your hero will undergo throughout the story. A combination of steps 20, 3, and 5, this framework provides you with the structure of your hero’s "journey." Remember that in Chapter 4, we explained that you had to start with the culmination of the hero’s development, that is, with awareness, then go back to the beginning to find his weakness and need, as well as his desire. You must proceed in the same way to create the plot.

By starting with the framework of the story—from awareness, to weakness, to need, and desire—you determine the culmination of the plot. This way, all the steps you go through afterward will automatically lead you to where you want to go.

At this stage of plot development, you must ask yourself the following questions and be as precise as possible in your answers:

• What will my hero learn at the end?

• What does he know at the beginning? No character is a blank slate at the beginning of the story. A character always believes something.

• What is he wrong about at the beginning? Your hero cannot learn something at the end of the story if he is not wrong about something at the beginning.

CASABLANCA

• Awareness Rick understands that he cannot withdraw from the fight for freedom because of a broken heart.

• Psychological need Overcome his bitterness towards Ilsa, find a reason to live, and renew his faith in his ideals.

• Moral need Stop being interested only in himself at the expense of others.

• Desire Get Ilsa back.

• Initial error Rick considers himself a dead, immobile man. He is no longer interested in world affairs.

TOOTSIE

• Awareness Michael understands that he has treated women as sexual objects and that he has not been a worthy man.

• Psychological need Overcome his arrogance towards women and, in love, learn to give and receive sincerely.

• Moral need Stop lying and using women to get what he wants.

• Desire Julie, one of the actresses in the series.

• Initial error Michael finds his behavior perfectly normal and thinks he is right to lie to women.

2. Ghost and story world

Step 1 allowed us to establish the framework of the story. From step 2, we will work on the structural steps in the order they appear in a typical story. Remember, however, that the number and order of steps may differ depending on the particularity of the story you want to tell.

Ghost

You have probably heard the word "backstory." This word refers to all the events that occurred in the hero’s life before the story being told. We rarely use the term "backstory" because it is too broad to be useful. The audience is not interested in all the events that occurred in the hero’s life. They are interested in the essential events. That is why the term "ghost" is more appropriate.

There are two types of ghosts. The first, which is the most common, is a past event that continues to haunt the hero in the present. The ghost is an open wound that is often the source of the hero’s moral and psychological weakness. The ghost allows for the psychological development of the hero to begin before the start of the story. The ghost is therefore a major element of the story’s foundations.

We can also consider this first type of ghost as the hero’s internal opponent. It is the great fear that prevents him from acting. Structurally, the ghost acts as a counter-desire. The hero’s desire pushes him forward; the ghost pulls him back. Henrik Ibsen, who placed great importance on the ghost in his plays, spoke of "sailing with a corpse in the hold."

HAMLET

(William Shakespeare, 1601)

Shakespeare was a writer who knew the value of a ghost. Before the first page of the story, Hamlet’s uncle murdered his father, the king, and then married his mother. And as if all this didn’t make enough ghosts, Shakespeare introduces in the first pages of the play the actual ghost of the king, who asks Hamlet to avenge him. Hamlet says: "The time is out of joint. O cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right!"

IT’S A WONDERFUL LIFE

(novel, The Greatest Gift, by Philip Van Doren Stern, screenplay by Francis Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Frank Capra, 1946)

George Bailey’s desire is to see the world and build things. But his ghost—his fear of what the tyrant Potter would do to his family and friends if he left—holds him back.

The other type of ghost, rarer, is the story in which the ghost is not conceivable because the hero lives in a paradisiacal world. Instead of starting the story in bondage—partly because of his ghost—the hero is initially free. But an attack soon changes the order of things. Meet Me in St. Louis and The Deer Hunter are good illustrations of this type of ghost.

We must warn you of one thing here: you must not "over-write" the exposition at the beginning of the story. Many authors, from the first page, try to tell the audience everything about their hero, including how and why the ghost haunts him. This mass of information only distracts the audience from the story. Instead, try to hide as much information as possible about the hero, including the details of his ghost. The reader or viewer will guess that you are hiding something and will literally enter your story. They will say: "There is something fishy, and I want to understand what it is."

The events constituting the ghost are rarely mentioned in the early scenes. It is much more common for another character to expose and explain the hero’s ghost during the first third of the story. (On rare occasions, the ghost is exposed during awareness, that is, towards the end of the story. But this is generally a bad idea because the ghost—the power of the past—then dominates the story and continues to pull everything backward.)

Story world

Just like the ghost, the story world is present from the very beginning of the story. It is the place where the hero lives. This world, which includes an "arena," natural settings, atmospheric conditions, man-made spaces, technology, and its own time, represents one of the main ways to define the hero and other characters. Conversely, these characters and their values define the story world. (For more details, refer to Chapter 6, "The Story World.")

KEY POINT: The story world must express your hero’s personality. It must show his weaknesses, needs, desires, and obstacles.

KEY POINT: If, at the beginning of your story, your hero is, in some way, enslaved, the story world must be enslaving and must highlight or exacerbate his major weakness.

You place your hero in the story world from the very first page. But understand that several of the steps we present here will have their own sub-world.

People often think that when writing neither fantasy nor science fiction, they can quickly sketch the world to focus more on the hero’s line of desire. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whatever type of story you are writing, you must create a unique and detailed world. The audience loves to project themselves into a special world. If you take care of the story world, readers or viewers will not want to leave it, and they will return to it again and again.

CASABLANCA

• Ghost Rick fought against the fascists in Spain and sold weapons to the Ethiopians so they could defeat the Italians. The reasons for his departure from America remain obscure. Rick is haunted by the memory of Ilsa, who left him in Paris.

• Story world The screenwriters of Casablanca spent a lot of time detailing a very complex story world from the beginning of the film. Using a map (a miniature), a voice-over narrator presents the masses of refugees fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe to reach the distant desert base of Casablanca in North Africa. Instead of quickly moving to the main character’s desire, the film lingers on the refugees, all seeking a visa to leave Casablanca and head to free Portugal or America. It is a community of world citizens imprisoned like animals in a pen.

The screenwriters continued to detail the story world through a scene in which the Nazi major Strasser meets the French police chief, Captain Renault, at the airport. Casablanca is a confused world mixing political powers, a world of limbo: the city is theoretically governed by Vichy France, but the real power lies in the hands of the Nazi occupier.

Within the arena of Casablanca, Rick has created a small island of power in his bar and casino, Rick’s Café Américain. He is depicted as a king surrounded by his court. It is a world where all the secondary characters play clearly defined roles. Moreover, part of the pleasure the audience derives from this film comes from how all these characters seem to feel comfortable in this hierarchy. Ironically, this film about freedom fighters is, in a sense, very anti-democratic.

The bar is also a venal place, a perfect representation of Rick’s cynicism and selfishness.

TOOTSIE

• Ghost Michael is not haunted by any specific past event. But he has a reputation for being impossible to manage, which is why he can no longer find work.

• Story world From the start, Michael is immersed in the world of comedy and the New York entertainment industry. It is a world that values appearances, fame, and money. This system is extremely hierarchical, with a few rare star actors at its top who grab all the good roles and a mass of unknowns fighting at the bottom of the ladder for roles and having to work as waiters to pay their rent. Michael’s life consists of teaching the art of comedy, multiplying auditions, and arguing with directors about how the role should be played.

Once Michael, disguised as Dorothy, gets a role in a soap opera, the story focuses on the world of television series. It is a theater totally dominated by commerce, where actors play a silly melodramatic scene at record speed to quickly move on to another. It is also a sexist world dominated by an arrogant director who orders all the women on set.

In Michael’s world, the man-made spaces are the small apartments of hardworking actors and the television studio where the series is filmed. The studio is a place of acting, a place of pretense, perfect for a man trying to pass as a woman. The tools of this world are the tools of the acting profession: voice, body, hair, makeup, and costume. The screenwriters created a good parallel between the makeup Michael uses to play his role in the series and the makeup Michael uses to play his role as a woman in front of the camera and off-screen.

The superficial and sexist world of the soap opera expresses and exacerbates Michael’s major weakness: he is a sexist man willing to lie and betray others’ trust to get a role.

3. Weakness and need

• Weakness The hero has one or more flaws so significant that they ruin his life. Weakness comes in two different forms: it can be psychological or moral. But these two categories are not exclusive; a character can very well combine both.

Every weakness is psychological. In some way, the person is deeply wounded. A weakness also has a moral aspect when it leads the character to hurt others as well. A character with a moral weakness always has a negative impact on at least one other character.

KEY POINT: Many authors think they have given their hero a moral weakness when it is actually only psychological. For the weakness you have given your hero to be moral, he must hurt at least one other character at the beginning of the story.

• Need The need is what the hero must accomplish to improve his life. It almost always involves overcoming his weakness towards the end of the story.

• Problem The problem is the crisis the hero faces at the very beginning of the story. The hero is aware of the crisis but does not know how to solve it. The problem is usually an extension of the hero’s weakness, and it is designed to quickly present this weakness to the audience. Although it must be present at the beginning of the story, the problem is far less important than the weakness and need.

CASABLANCA

Rick seems to want nothing and need nothing. But that’s because he hides his need. He appears stronger than others, self-satisfied. If his cynical nature may suggest he is a deeply troubled man, he remains the master of his world. He runs his club like a kind of benevolent dictator. He is also a man who controls women. And he is a man of extreme contradictions: while he now appears cynical, bitter, and sometimes immoral, he was, not so long ago, a freedom fighter.
What is original in this film is that the main character, who is nevertheless someone who controls his world, begins the story by observing and remaining passive. Rick is a man with a lot of power and a long history, but he has chosen to stop doing good and retreat to one of the most remote corners of the world, Casablanca—and deep within himself. Rick is a lion locked in a cage he created himself.

• Weakness Rick is cynical, passive, selfish, and has lost his illusions.

• Psychological need To overcome his bitterness towards Ilsa, Rick must find a reason to live and renew his faith in his ideals.

• Moral need Stop being interested only in himself at the expense of others.

• Problem Rick is trapped in Casablanca and trapped in his world of bitterness.

TOOTSIE

• Weakness Michael is selfish, arrogant, and a liar.

• Psychological need Overcome his arrogance towards women and, in love, learn to give and receive honestly.

• Moral need Stop lying and using women to get what he wants.

• Problem Michael can't find roles.

Openings

The spectrum, the universe of the story, the weakness, the need, and the problem are the different elements that make up the opening of your story, which is decisive. There are three types of structural openings that establish these elements.

The "community" start

The main character lives in a paradisiacal world where territory, populations, and technology are in perfect harmony. Therefore, the hero has no spectrum. He is happy, has only minor problems, or no problems at all, but is also vulnerable to attack. This attack, which will come either from outside or inside, does not take long to occur. Meet Me in St. Louis and The Deer Hunter are good representatives of this warm and friendly type of opening.

The fast start

The classic opening, designed to hold the reader's attention from the first pages, is composed of a number of structural elements. The hero has a strong spectrum. He lives in a world of servitude, has several significant weaknesses, as well as both a psychological and moral need, and he must face one or more problems. This type of opening is found in most good stories.

The slow start

The slow start is not an opening in which the author has omitted to include some of the structural steps of the fast start. It is the opening of stories whose hero is aimless.

For it must not be forgotten that there are people who have no goal. But the pace of the stories that talk about them is extremely slow. As the hero's awareness corresponds to the awareness of his true desire (which allows him to set a goal), the first three-quarters of the story have no objective, and the narrative therefore has no narrative line. Very few stories have been able to overcome this enormous structural obstacle. On the Waterfront and Rebel Without a Cause are good examples of success.

4. Inciting Event

This is an event from the outside that leads the hero to set a goal and act.

The inciting event is a small step, but it nevertheless has an important function: it connects need and desire. At the beginning of the story, when the foundations of weakness and need are established, the hero is, in one way or another, paralyzed. Therefore, there must be an external event that pushes him out of his paralysis and into action.

KEY POINT: To find a good inciting event, keep in mind the expression "out of the frying pan into the fire."

A good inciting event is one that makes your hero think he has just overcome the crisis he has been facing since the beginning of the story. But in reality, because of this event, the hero has just gotten himself into the worst mess of his life.

In Sunset Boulevard, for example, Joe is a screenwriter who can't find work. Two men come to repossess his car, and he flees. Suddenly, his tire blows out (inciting event). Joe turns into Norma Desmond's driveway and thinks he's out of trouble. What he doesn't know is that he's just fallen into a trap he will never escape.

CASABLANCA

Ilsa and Laszlo come to find Rick. They are the characters from the outside who will push Rick out of his stable but unhappy position.

TOOTSIE

George, Michael's agent, explains to him that no one wants to hire him anymore because of his terrible character. This is what pushes Michael to disguise himself as a woman and audition for the soap opera.

5. Desire

Desire is the hero's specific goal. It is the backbone of the plot. When we talked about the seven steps in chapter 3, we said that to create a good story, there must be a goal that is specific and present over a large part of the narrative. Here we must give you another piece of advice: at the start, the goal must be put on hold.

The story is built by gradually increasing the importance of desire. If you start with too strong a desire, you won't be able to increase its intensity, and the plot will seem flat and repetitive. You must therefore start with a desire that is weak enough to be able to move forward.

When you build desire throughout the story, be careful not to create a new desire. You must increase the intensity and stakes of the original desire.

CASABLANCA

Rick desires Ilsa. But since it's a love story, this desire is dulled because Ilsa is also Rick's first adversary. Since Rick resents her for leaving him in Paris, he first seeks to hurt her.

Rick's desire for Ilsa being frustrated, the story focuses on another character's desire: Laszlo's, who wants to obtain exit visas for himself and his wife. But the screenwriters have defined Rick's desire clearly and early enough, which tends to ease the audience's impatience when Laszlo's actions are presented because they know Rick's desire will soon take over. The wait actually allows the desire to "simmer."

Towards the end of the story, Rick begins to feel a second desire in contradiction with the first: he wants to help Ilsa and Laszlo escape. If he had felt this contradictory desire earlier, the story would have had two backbones. But this desire arriving near the end and remaining hidden until the last moment becomes both a discovery and part of Rick's realization.

TOOTSIE

Initially, Michael wants to get a role. But this desire is very quickly fulfilled. The goal that truly serves as the backbone of the film is Michael's desire for Julie, one of the actresses in the series.

TECHNIQUE: THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF DESIRE

Part of the success of your story depends on the degree of desire you give your hero. A desire that remains weak throughout the story diminishes the hero, and, as for the plot, makes any complexity literally impossible. The weakest degree of desire, for example, is survival. The hero is attacked and seeks to escape. This lowers him to the animal stage. The plot of escape stories tends to simply repeat the same highlights of the escape.

Below are the different degrees of some of the classic lines of desire, from weakest to strongest:

1. Survive (escape)

2. Take revenge

3. Win the fight

4. Accomplish something

5. Explore a world

6. Catch a criminal

7. Discover the truth

8. Win love

9. Restore justice and freedom

10. Save the republic

11. Save the world

6. Ally(ies)

Once the hero is equipped with a line of desire, he usually needs to make one or more allies who will help him defeat the adversary and achieve his goal. An ally cannot simply be the spokesperson for the hero's opinions (although this function is important, especially in theater, film, and television). The ally is a key element of the character network and represents one of the main ways to define the hero.

KEY POINT: Consider giving the ally their own line of desire. You have relatively little time to define this character. The quickest way to convince the audience that they are watching a complete person is to give this character a goal. In The Wizard of Oz, for example, the Scarecrow wants a brain.

KEY POINT: Never make the ally a more interesting character than the hero. Remember the rule we stated when we talked about the premise: you must always write the story of the most interesting character. If your ally is more interesting than your hero, you need to rethink the story so that the ally becomes the hero.

CASABLANCA

Rick's allies are the various characters who play a role in the bar: Carl, the professor turned waiter; Sacha, the Russian bartender; Émile, the croupier; Abdul, the bouncer; and Rick's sidekick, Sam, the piano player.

TOOTSIE

Jeff, Michael's roommate, is writing a play, Return to the Love Canal, and Michael wants it to be staged so he can play a role in it.

TECHNIQUE: THE SUBPLOT

In chapter 4 (Characters), we said that the subplot had a precise definition and function: it serves to compare how the hero and another character approach two situations that are generally identical.

Remember the two key rules of the subplot:

1. The subplot can only exist if it impacts the main plot. If the subplot does not play a role in the main plot, you end up with two simultaneous stories that may be clinically interesting but will tend to make the main plot too long. To connect the subplot to the main plot, make sure it generally joins it towards the end. In Hamlet, for example, the secondary character, Laertes, allies with Hamlet's main adversary, Claudius, and duels with Hamlet in the confrontation scene.

2. The secondary character is generally not an ally. The secondary character and the ally fulfill two distinct functions in the story. The ally helps the hero in the main plot. The secondary character leads a different plot from the main plot, but similar in some aspects, allowing for a comparison between the two.

Most American films today combine several genres, but few have true subplots. The subplot tends to broaden the story, and most American screenwriters are too concerned with speed to worry about that. The films where subplots are most often found are love stories, as this genre tends to generate thin main plots. In Moonstruck, for example, there are two subplots, one involving the heroine's father and the other her mother. The main plot and the subplots all deal with the problem of fidelity.

If the subplot is not part of the twenty-two steps, it's because it is rarely used and is a plot in itself with its own structure. But it remains an excellent technique to improve characters and theme and to flesh out the story. On the other hand, the subplot tends to slow down the line of desire—the narrative momentum. You must therefore determine what is most important to you.

If you decide to create a subplot, be aware that you will only have enough time for the seven steps. And know that if you can't go through all of them, your story will seem incomplete and incongruous. Due to the limited time you have, you should also try to introduce your subplot as early as possible in your story.

7. Adversary / Mystery

The adversary is the character who seeks to prevent the hero from achieving his goal. The relationship between this character and the hero is the most important of all the relationships in the story. If you establish the foundations of this opposition adequately, your plot will unfold as it should. But know that if you fail, no rewriting will ever save your story.

The best adversary is the one who is necessary: the character most able to attack the hero's major weakness. He thus pushes the hero to overcome his major weakness and develop or annihilates him. Go back to chapter 4 (Characters) to study again the different elements necessary for any good adversary.

Here are the two main reasons why the adversary and the mystery are closely linked:

1. A mysterious adversary is much more difficult to defeat. In most stories, the hero's only task is to defeat the adversary. In good stories, the hero's mission is divided into two parts: unmask the adversary, then defeat him. This makes the hero's task twice as difficult and makes his success a much greater accomplishment.

Hamlet, for example, does not know if the king really killed his father, as it is a ghost who revealed this information to him. Othello does not know that Iago wants to destroy him. Lear wonders which of his daughters really loves him.

2. In certain types of stories, such as detective stories and thrillers, the mystery is necessary to compensate for the absence of the adversary. Since in detective stories the adversary remains hidden until the end, the audience needs something to replace the ongoing conflict between the hero and the adversary. In this type of story, the mystery must be introduced at the point where the main adversary usually appears.

Before introducing your main adversary, ask yourself the following questions:

• Who is trying to prevent the hero from getting what he wants and why?

• What does the adversary want? He must be in competition with the hero for the goal.

• What are the adversary's values and how do they differ from those of the hero? Most authors never ask themselves this question, and it is a big mistake. A story without a conflict of values, like a story without a conflict of characters, cannot be built.

CASABLANCA

Since Casablanca is fundamentally a love story, Rick's first adversary is the one he loves, Ilsa Lund. This mysterious woman did not tell Rick that she was, and still is, married to Victor Laszlo. Rick's second adversary is the other suitor, Laszlo, the great man who has impressed half the world. The two men hate the Nazis, but they represent two very different versions of the great man. Laszlo's greatness is political and social while Rick's greatness is personal.

Major Strasser and the Nazis provide the external opposition and danger that elevate the love story to a higher level. Strasser is in no way mysterious, but he doesn't need to be: in Casablanca, he is all-powerful.

TOOTSIE

Since Tootsie's structure relies on the form of farce (as well as romantic comedy), the film does not use the mysterious adversary technique. Farce is a form that has more adversaries than any other and works on the rhythm of the attacks they lead. Here is how Michael's main adversaries attack his weakness:

• Julie forces him to reflect on how he behaves with women.

• Ron, the arrogant director, didn't want Dorothy (Michael) for the role and is therefore unpleasant with her.

• Les, Julie's father, unknowingly reveals to Michael the consequences of his dishonesty when he is seduced by Dorothy.

• John, one of the actors in the series, also makes unwanted advances to Dorothy.

TECHNIQUE: THE ICEBERG ADVERSARY

It is extremely important to make the adversary mysterious, regardless of the story you are writing. Think of the adversary as an iceberg. A piece of the iceberg is visible. But its larger part is hidden beneath the surface, and it is by far the most dangerous. There are four techniques that can help you make the opposition as dangerous as possible:

1. Create a hierarchy of adversaries with a number of alliances. All adversaries are linked to each other; they work together to defeat the hero. The main adversary is at the top of the pyramid, with the others under his power. (Refer to the section of chapter 4 that deals with the four-corner opposition. You will find an illustration of this technique at the end of this chapter, where the example of The Godfather is developed.)

2. Hide this hierarchy from the hero and the audience, and hide the true agenda (desire) of each adversary.

3. Reveal all this information gradually and at an increasingly fast pace. This means there must be more twists at the end of the story. As we have seen, it is the way information is revealed to the hero and the audience that makes the plot.

4. Have the hero face an obvious adversary at the beginning of the story. Then, as the conflict intensifies, the hero must discover attacks coming from a stronger and hidden opposition, or from the part of the adversary that has been concealed.

8. False Ally

The false ally is a character who appears to be an ally of the hero but is actually an adversary or an emissary of the main adversary.

The plot is driven by twists-revelations, which come from the steps the hero takes in discovering the true power of the opposition. Every time the hero discovers something new about his adversary—a revelation—the plot "bounces," much to the audience's delight. The false ally increases the power of the adversary because he represents hidden opposition. He forces the hero and the audience to dig beneath the surface of the iceberg and discover what the hero is really fighting against.

If the false ally is so important, it's also because he is inherently complex. This character often undergoes a fascinating transformation during the story. By pretending to be the hero's ally, the false ally ends up feeling like an ally. He becomes torn by a dilemma: he works for the adversary but wants the hero to win.

The false ally is usually introduced after the main adversary, but not necessarily. If the adversary has devised a plan to defeat the hero before the story begins, the false ally must be introduced first.

CASABLANCA

While always being sympathetic and charming with Rick, Captain Renault protects himself by working for the Nazis. Renault is much more open in his opposition than the vast majority of false allies who work undercover. At the very end of the story, Renault makes a 180-degree turn to become a true ally of Rick. It is one of the best twists in the story and a good example of the power of storytelling that comes from character reversals, turning from allies to adversaries or from adversaries to allies.

TOOTSIE

Sandy is also not the usual false ally who deceives the hero and the audience from the beginning of the story. Initially, she is an actress who is friends with Michael. She becomes a false ally when Michael disguises himself as a woman to get the role she also wants. When she catches Michael trying on her clothes, he only increases her disappointment by pretending he has fallen in love with her.

9. First Twist-Revelation and Decision: Modification of Desire and Motivations

At this point in the story, the hero makes a discovery: he discovers new and surprising information. This information forces him to make a decision and take a new direction. It can also lead him to clarify his desire and motivations. Motivations are the reasons that drive the hero to desire the goal. The four events that constitute the twist-revelation, the decision, the modification of desire, and that of motivations must occur at the same time.

Twists are key elements of the plot. However, they are absent from most stories. In many ways, the quality of your plot comes from the quality of your twists. Keep these techniques in mind:

1. The best twists are those that concern the adversary. The new information discovered by the hero about him tends to intensify the conflict. They are also the ones that have the most impact on the outcome of the plot.

2. The modified desire must be a deviation from the original desire; it must not be a break from it. Think of the modified desire as a river that changes course. If, at this point, you give your hero a completely different desire from the first, you start a new story. You must clarify and intensify the original line of desire.

3. Each twist-revelation must be explosive and stronger than the one that preceded it. If it is not important information, the story will remain flat. And each twist-revelation must build on the one that preceded it. The plot must literally "thicken." Think of the twists-revelations as the gears of a car. With each gear change, the car (the story) accelerates, and, by the last gear, it is at full speed. The audience doesn't understand how they got to such speed, but what is certain is that they are having a good time.

If the intensity of the twists does not gradually increase, the plot will remain flat or even decline. And that is what must be avoided at all costs.

Note that, in recent years, Hollywood has become more aware of the importance of plot, which makes the trust screenwriters place in the three-act structure even more dangerous. Remember that this structure requires two or three twists-revelations. Besides being completely wrong, this advice can only provide you with a shabby plot that will have no chance of breaking into the professional film world. Today, the average American film has between seven and ten twists. Some types of films, including detective stories and thrillers, have even more. Set aside the three-act structure and learn advanced plot creation techniques. You will put all the chances on your side.

CASABLANCA

• Twist-revelation Ilsa shows up at Rick's bar late at night.

• Decision Rick decides to hurt her deeply.
• Modified Desire Before Ilsa's arrival, Rick simply wanted to run his bar, make money, and have peace. Now, he wants Ilsa to suffer as much as he does.

• Modified Motivations She deserves it because she broke his heart in Paris.

TOOTSIE

• Twist-Revelation Michael discovers he has real power when "Dorothy" acts like a diva at the soap opera audition and dismisses Ron, the director.

• Decision Michael, as Dorothy, decides to behave like a powerful woman who gets straight to the point.

• Modified Desire No. Michael still wants the role.

• Modified Motivations He now knows how to get the role his way.

TECHNIQUE: ADDITIONAL TWISTS-REVELATIONS

The more twists-revelations there are, the richer and more complex your plot will be. A twist-revelation occurs whenever the hero or the audience learns new information.

KEY POINT: The twist-revelation must be significant enough to push the hero to make a decision and change the course of their actions.

TOOTSIE

• Twist-Revelation Michael discovers he is attracted to Julie, one of the actresses in the series.

• Decision Michael decides to befriend Julie.

• Modified Desire Michael wants Julie.

• Modified Motivations He is falling in love with her.

10. Plan

The plan is the set of directives or strategies the hero will use to defeat their adversary and achieve the goal.

KEY POINT: Be careful not to let the hero simply follow their plan. Your plot would become predictable and your hero superficial. In almost all good stories, the hero's initial plan fails. At this point in the story, the adversary is still too strong for the hero, who must think hard to develop a better strategy considering the adversary's strengths and weapons.

CASABLANCA

Rick's initial plan to win back Ilsa is both aggressive and passive: he knows she will return to him, and he tells her bluntly. His main plan, which he develops relatively late in the story, is to use Ugarte's exit visas to help Ilsa and Laszlo escape the Nazis. The advantage of this late plan is that it provides rapid and stunning twists at the end of the story.

TOOTSIE

Michael's plan is to remain disguised as a woman while convincing Julie to break up with her fiancé, Ron. He must also fend off advances from Les and John without them realizing he is actually a man. And he must deceive Sandy into believing he loves her and lying to her about the soap opera role.

TECHNIQUE: TRAINING

Most heroes are already trained to do what they need to succeed. Their failure in the first part of the plot comes from an omission: they haven't introspected and confronted their weakness.

But training plays an important role in certain genres, where it often represents the most popular part of the plot. It is very common in sports and war stories (including suicide missions like The Dirty Dozen) and heist stories (like Ocean's Eleven). Training is usually placed right after the plan and before the main lines of action and conflict.

11. Adversary's Plan and Main Counterattack

The adversary, like the hero, has a plan consisting of several steps to achieve the goal. They develop a strategy and begin executing a series of attacks aimed at the hero. We cannot stress enough the importance of this step, yet most writers completely overlook it.

As we have already explained, the plot largely relies on twists. To create twists, you must hide the means used by the adversary to attack the hero. You must therefore create a detailed plan for the adversary, including as many secret attacks as possible. Each of these attacks, when it hits the hero, will constitute a new twist.

KEY POINT: The more complex your adversary's plan and the better you hide it, the more interesting your plot will be.

CASABLANCA

• Adversary's Plan Ilsa tries to convince Rick that she had good reasons to leave him and that Laszlo must flee Casablanca. Major Strasser's plan is to pressure Captain Renault to keep Laszlo in Casablanca and intimidate anyone, including Rick, who might try to help him escape.

• Main Counterattack When Rick refuses Laszlo's offer to buy the letters, Ilsa comes to him and threatens him with a weapon. Strasser's main attack occurs after Laszlo inflames the French in the bar by having the orchestra play La Marseillaise. Strasser orders the bar closed and tells Ilsa that if she doesn't return to occupied France with Laszlo, he will either be imprisoned or killed. Later that night, he pushes Captain Renault to arrest Laszlo.

TOOTSIE

As it is a romantic comedy and a farce, each of Michael-Dorothy's adversaries has a plan based on what they think the character is. The plot is ingeniously constructed on escalating attacks from the adversaries: Dorothy must share her room and bed with Julie, Dorothy must take care of Julie's crying baby, Julie mistakenly thinks Dorothy is a lesbian, Les and John court Dorothy, and Sandy is furious with Michael for lying to her.

This cyclone effect is one of the pleasures of the farce form, but Tootsie gives it a strong emotional impact, an impact that most farces lack. Michael's gender changes play on the audience's feelings and tend to unsettle them more quickly and intensely. It's excellent writing.

12. Narrative Dynamism

Dynamism corresponds to the series of actions undertaken by the hero to defeat the adversary and win. Representing what is usually the largest section of the plot, these actions begin with the hero's plan (step 10) and continue until the apparent defeat (step 14).

During this period, the adversary is generally too strong for the hero, who tends to lose the competition. The hero is therefore desperate and often commits immoral actions to win (these immoral acts are part of the story's moral debate; see chapter 5).

KEY POINT: During this period, your plot must develop, not repeat. In other words, you must radically change your hero's actions. Do not repeat the same highlights (the same actions or events) over and over.

In a love story, for example, two characters falling in love might go to the beach, then to the movies, then to a park, and finally to a restaurant. These are indeed four different actions, but they correspond to the same highlight of the plot. The plot repeats, it does not develop.

For the plot to develop, your hero must react to the new information they have learned about the adversary (i.e., again, to twists) and adapt their strategy and course of actions accordingly.

CASABLANCA

The main characteristic of Rick's dynamism is that it is postponed. This is not a flaw in the script. It stems from Rick's character, his weakness, and his desire. Rick is paralyzed by bitterness and thinks nothing has value in the world. He wants Ilsa, but Ilsa is his adversary and is with another man. Thus, at the beginning and middle of the story, Rick talks to Ilsa but does not actively seek to win her back. In fact, he initially dismisses her.

This postponement of desire, while required by Rick's character, is not without consequences: it generates dead times that tend to diminish the audience's interest. Laszlo seeking exit visas from Ferrari, Laszlo at the police station, Laszlo seeking exit visas from Rick, Laszlo with Ilsa, Laszlo fleeing the underground meeting, all these constitute deviations from the hero's dynamism.

But the postponement of desire also has two major advantages. First, the writers relied on Laszlo's actions to build the epic and political aspect of the story. Although these actions have nothing to do with the hero's dynamism, they are necessary for this story because they give the ultimate twist and Rick's final decision a global scope.

Secondly, by waiting so long to show Rick embarking on his quest, the writers gave themselves the advantage of having climaxes and twists-revelations follow one another rapidly.

When Ilsa enters Rick's room and declares her love, Rick finally acts, and the story ignites. Of course, the great irony is that if Rick suddenly multiplies actions, it is precisely to ensure he does not bring Ilsa back to him. The change in motivations and goal of the main character – who initially wanted to win back Ilsa and now wants to help her escape with Laszlo – occurs just after Rick has begun his quest for Ilsa. Moreover, the most exciting part of this last quarter of the film is the uncertainty surrounding the goal Rick seeks to achieve.

KEY POINT: This uncertainty regarding two goals only works because it exists over a short period of time and is part of the great twist in the final confrontation.

• Steps of Dynamism

1. Rick remembers the moments he spent with Ilsa in Paris.

2. Rick calls Ilsa a tramp when she returns to his café.

3. Rick tries to reconcile with Ilsa at the market, but she rejects him.

4. Rick refuses to return the transit letters to Renault.

5. After seeing Ilsa, Rick helps the Bulgarian couple find enough money to pay Renault.

6. Rick refuses to give the letters to Laszlo. He tells him to ask Ilsa to explain her refusal.

7. Rick refuses to give the letters to Ilsa, who confesses she still loves him.

8. Rick tells Ilsa he will help Laszlo, and only Laszlo, escape.

9. Rick asks Carl to sneak Ilsa out of the bar while he talks to Laszlo, who is then arrested.

TOOTSIE

• Steps of Dynamism

1. Michael buys women's clothes and explains to Jeff how hard it is to be a woman.

2. He lies to Sandy about his new source of income.

3. He practices doing his own makeup and hair.

4. He improvises to avoid kissing a man.

5. He befriends Julie.

6. He lies to Sandy, saying he is sick.

7. He invites Sandy again.

8. He helps April rehearse.

9. He helps Julie rehearse and asks her why she puts up with Ron.

10. He lies to Sandy when he arrives late for their date.

11. He improvises lines to make Dorothy a stronger woman.

12. He improvises lines with Julie.

13. He asks George to help him find more interesting roles now that he knows how to act like a real woman.

14. Michael, as a man, makes advances to Julie, but she rejects him.

15. As Dorothy, he asks Ron to stop calling him "Tootsie."

16. He lies to Sandy to go to the countryside with Julie.

17. At the farm, he falls in love with Julie.

18. The producer tells Michael he wants to renew Dorothy's contract.

13. Attack from an Ally

At one point in the narrative dynamism, the hero loses the fight against the adversary and despairs. When he begins to act immorally to regain the upper hand, the ally confronts him.

At this moment, the ally becomes the hero's conscience. They essentially say, "I'm trying to help you achieve your goal, but you're going about it the wrong way." Generally, the hero tries to defend himself and refuses to accept the ally's criticism (for more details on writing moral dialogue, refer to chapter 10, "Scene Construction and Symphonic Dialogues").

The ally's attack elevates the story to its second stage of conflict (the first being the hero vs. the opposition). This attack increases the pressure on the hero and forces him to start questioning his values and actions.

CASABLANCA

• Ally's Critique Rick is criticized not by one of his allies but by his first adversary, Ilsa. At the market, she reproaches him for no longer being the man she knew in Paris. When Rick makes advances, she tells him she was married to Laszlo before meeting him.

• Hero's Justification Rick does not try to justify his words and simply says he was drunk the night before.

TOOTSIE

• Ally's Critique When Michael pretends to be sick to get rid of Sandy and go to the countryside with Julie, Jeff asks him how long he plans to keep lying to people.

• Hero's Justification Michael replies that it's better to lie to a woman than to hurt her by telling the truth.

14. Apparent Defeat

At one point in the narrative dynamism, the hero loses the fight against the adversary. Around two-thirds or three-quarters of the story, the hero experiences an apparent defeat. He thinks he has lost the competition for the goal and that the adversary has won. He has reached his lowest point.

The apparent defeat is an important punctuation of the narrative structure because it corresponds to the moment when the hero hits rock bottom. It increases the dramatic aspect of the story by forcing the hero to rise again to eventually win. Just as a sports event is more interesting when the team you support comes back to win, a story is more interesting when the audience's beloved hero rises from what appears to be certain defeat.

KEY POINT: The apparent defeat is not a small temporary failure. It must truly be a devastating experience for the hero. And the audience must truly believe the hero is finished.

KEY POINT: Your story should only include one apparent defeat. While the hero can experience several failures, the story can only include one moment where everything seems completely lost. Otherwise, it would lack coherence and dramatic power. To understand the difference, think of a car speeding down a hill and, one: hitting two or three big speed bumps or, two: crashing into a brick wall.

CASABLANCA

Rick's apparent defeat occurs quite early in the narrative dynamism when Ilsa visits him after the bar closes at night. Drunk, he remembers their affair in Paris and its terrible ending, the moment Ilsa didn't show up at the train station. As she tries to explain what happened, he bitterly attacks her and sends her away.

TOOTSIE

George explains to Michael that he cannot break the contract binding him to the soap opera. He must continue living this nightmare, disguised as a woman.

Apparent Victory

In stories that end with the hero's death or total subjugation, the apparent defeat stage is replaced by the apparent victory stage. The hero reaches the peak of their success or power before starting a downward slope. This moment often corresponds to when the hero enters a sub-world of temporary freedom (see chapter 6, "The Story's Universe"). This apparent victory stage appears, for example, in Goodfellas when the characters successfully rob Lufthansa. They think they've pulled off the heist of the century. But in reality, this success marks the beginning of a process that will end in the death and destruction of all the characters.

15. Second Twist-Revelation and Decision: Obsessive Dynamism, Modified Desire and Motivations

Just after his apparent defeat, the hero almost always makes another major discovery. If this were not the case, his defeat would not be apparent but real, and the story would be over. At this precise moment, the hero obtains new information proving that victory is still possible. And he decides to resume the fight and relaunch the quest for the goal.

This important twist-revelation has a galvanizing effect on the hero. If, previously, he desired the goal (desire and narrative dynamism), he is now obsessed with the goal. And he would literally do anything to obtain it.

In short, at this point in the plot, the hero becomes tyrannical in his quest for the goal. You will notice that while he is strengthened by the new information he has obtained, he also tends to continue his moral decline, begun at the start of the narrative dynamism (this is one of the stages of the story's moral debate).

The second twist-revelation also pushes the hero to modify his desire and motivations. Again, the story takes a new direction. Ensure that these five elements – twist-revelation, decision, obsession, modified desire, and motivations – are all present. If not, the pressure drops, and the plot becomes weak.

CASABLANCA

• Twist-Revelation Ilsa tells Rick she was married to Laszlo before meeting him, explaining why she stood him up in Paris.

• Decision Rick seems to make no decision, but he tells Renault that if anyone touches the letters, he will kill them.

• Modified Desire Rick no longer desires to hurt Ilsa.

• Obsessive Dynamism Rick's first obsessive dynamism begins when Ilsa shows up at the club. Rick desperately seeks to hurt her to avenge the pain she caused him. This is another unique element of Casablanca. Rick starts the story with a much higher degree of passion and obsession than most heroes. But this high degree of desire leads somewhere, as at the end of the story, Rick leaves to help other fighters save the world.

It should also be noted that Rick only appears to become more immoral as the story progresses. In reality, he has decided to help Ilsa and Laszlo escape together, and he is determined to succeed.

• Modified Motivations Rick has forgiven Ilsa.

TOOTSIE

• Twist-Revelation The soap opera producer tells Dorothy he wants her to sign another one-year contract.

• Decision Michael decides to ask George to help him break the contract.

• Modified Desire Michael wants to end this charade and get closer to Julie.

• Obsessive Dynamism Michael is determined to leave Dorothy behind.

• Modified Motivations Michael feels guilty about how decently Julie and Les have treated him.

Additional Twist-Revelation

• Twist-Revelation Les makes advances to Dorothy.

• Decision Dorothy leaves Les in the bar.

• Modified Desire Michael wants to stop misleading Les.

• Modified Motivations No. Michael still feels guilty.

You will notice that Michael's moral decline tends to increase, despite his guilt and desire to end his difficult situation. The longer he maintains the charade, the more he harms those around him.

16. Revelation for the Audience

This revelation corresponds to the moment when the audience – but not the hero – learns new information. This information usually concerns the true identity of the false ally. The audience realizes that the character they thought was the hero's friend is actually their enemy.

But whatever the nature of the information learned by the audience, this revelation plays an important role in the story for three main reasons:

1. It's a boost that revitalizes what is often a rather slow section of the plot.

2. It shows the audience the true power of the opposition.

3. It allows the audience to observe certain hidden elements of the plot staged dramatically and visually.

You will notice that the revelation for the audience marks a major turning point in the relationship between the hero and the audience. In most stories (farce being a notable exception), until this point, the audience made discoveries at the same time as the hero. This tended to create a direct relationship – an identity – between the hero and the audience.

But with this revelation, for the first time, the audience learns something before the hero. This tends to create a distance and place the audience in a position of superiority over the hero. And this is essential for many reasons, the main one being that it allows the audience to take a step back and see the entire process of the hero's transformation (which will reach its climax with the hero's realization).

CASABLANCA

Gun in hand, Rick forces Renault to call the airport control tower. But the audience sees that the captain is actually calling Major Strasser.

TOOTSIE

This step does not occur in Tootsie, mainly because Michael deceives the other characters. Since he is fooling them, he controls the situation, and the audience learns things at the same time as he does.

17. Third Twist-Revelation and Decision

The hero discovers new information about the means to defeat the adversary. If the story includes a false ally, this step often corresponds to the moment when the hero discovers the true identity of this character (which has already been revealed to the audience in step 16).

One might think that upon discovering the extent of the opposition, the hero would want to withdraw from the conflict. But this new information, on the contrary, must make him stronger and more confident because he now knows what he is up against.

CASABLANCA

• Twist-Revelation Ilsa comes to ask Rick for the letters and confesses she still loves him.

• Decision Rick decides to give the transit letters to Laszlo and Ilsa but hides this decision from Ilsa and the audience.

• Modified Desire Rick wants to save Ilsa and Laszlo from the Nazis.

• Modified Motivations Rick knows Ilsa must leave with Laszlo and help him defend his cause.

TOOTSIE

• Twist-Revelation When Michael gives Sandy the chocolates Les had given Dorothy, Sandy calls him a liar and a hypocrite.

• Decision Michael goes to George to help him break his contract.

• Modified Desire No. Michael still wants to leave the soap opera.

• Modified Motivations No. He cannot continue lying to all these people.

Additional Twist-Revelation

• Twist-Revelation When Dorothy gives Julie a gift, she tells her she doesn't want to see her anymore to avoid giving her false hopes.

• Decision Michael decides to tell her the truth.
- Modified Desire: No. Michael still wants Julie.

- Modified Motivations: Michael is in love with Julie and realizes he cannot "get" her as long as he continues playing the role of Dorothy.

18. Narrow Gate, Caudine Forks, and Encounter with Death

Towards the end of the story, the conflict between the hero and the adversary intensifies to such an extent that the pressure on the hero becomes almost unbearable. He has less and less room to maneuver, and often, the space he must pass through literally narrows. Ultimately, he must squeeze through a narrow gate or a long passage (while being attacked from all sides).

This is also the moment when the main character encounters "death." In myths, the hero descends into the Underworld and glimpses his future in the world of the dead.

In more modern stories, the encounter with death is psychological. The hero suddenly becomes aware of his own mortality; life is fleeting, and his could end at any moment. One might think that this realization would tend to make him abandon the conflict, knowing now that it could prove fatal. But instead, it drives him to fight harder. The hero tells himself: "If I want to give meaning to my life, I must fight for what I believe in. And I will do it here and now." The encounter with death is thus the trial that generally triggers the confrontation.

The narrow gate, the Caudine Forks, and the encounter with death are the most mobile stages of all and are often found in another part of the plot. The hero, for example, may have an encounter with death during his apparent defeat. He may pass under the Caudine Forks during the final battle (see the trench in Star Wars or the tower in Vertigo), or even after this battle, as Terry Malloy does at the end of On the Waterfront.

CASABLANCA

This stage corresponds to the moment when Rick strives to reach the airport with Ilsa, Laszlo, and Renault, while Major Strasser tries to catch up with them.

TOOTSIE

Michael passes under the Caudine Forks and experiences an escalation of nightmares when he must watch Amy, Julie's baby who won't stop crying; then face the situation when Julie pushes him away after he tries to kiss her; then dance with Les, who has fallen in love with Dorothy; then get rid of John, the actor who is also attracted to Dorothy; and finally refute Sandy's accusations after he gave her the candies Les had given him.

19. Final Confrontation

The confrontation is the final conflict. It determines who, the hero or the adversary, achieves the goal (if either does). The grand violent conflict, though common, is the least interesting form of confrontation. Violent confrontations have a lot of flash but little meaning. The confrontation should be an opportunity to clearly show the audience what the characters are fighting for. The focus should not be on strength but on values and ideas.

The confrontation is the convergence point of the story. It brings together all the characters and various lines of action. It takes place in a very confined space, which increases the conflict and unbearable pressure.

The confrontation generally (but not always) corresponds to the moment when the hero fulfills his need and obtains the desired object. It is also the moment when he shares the most traits with his adversary. But in this similarity, the determining differences that oppose them become even clearer.

The confrontation is also the moment when the theme explodes in the audience's mind. In the conflict of values, readers or viewers understand for the first time what the best way to act and live is.

CASABLANCA

At the airport, Rick points a gun at Renault and tells Ilsa she must leave with Laszlo. He then tells Laszlo that Ilsa has been faithful to him. Laszlo and Ilsa board the plane. Major Strasser arrives and tries to stop the plane, but Rick shoots him.

TOOTSIE

During a live taping of an episode of the series, Michael improvises a complicated monologue in which he explains that his character is actually a man. Then he removes his disguise, shocking both the audience and the other soap opera actors. When Michael finishes, Julie hits him and leaves.

The final conflict between Michael and Julie is rather light (reduced to a slap). The grand conflict has been replaced by a grand twist-revelation: Michael removes his mask in front of the cast and crew, and in front of a national audience.

The writers had a brilliant idea here: the complex monologue improvised by Michael follows the path of women's liberation ideas that Michael himself has taken by putting himself in a woman's shoes.

20. Realization

The trial of confrontation usually pushes the hero to transform deeply. For the first time, he becomes aware of who he truly is. He sheds the mask he has lived with until now and sees, in a moving way, his true self. Facing the truth about himself can either destroy him—as in Oedipus Rex, Vertigo, or The Conversation—or make him stronger.

If the realization is not only psychological but also moral, the hero also learns how he should behave with others. To have maximum dramatic impact, a good realization must be sudden; it should be overwhelming for the hero, whether positive or negative; and it must be something new, something the hero was unaware of about himself until that precise moment.

The quality of your story largely depends on the quality of the realization. Everything leads to this point. Therefore, you must take special care in writing this stage. And avoid the following two pitfalls:

1. What your hero learns about himself must be something very important. You cannot settle for a few pretty words or platitudes about life. This leads to a second warning.

2. Your hero must not directly tell the audience what he has learned. This is the mark of bad writers (in Chapter 10, "Construction of Scenes and Symphonic Dialogues," we will explain how to use dialogue to express realization without a moralizing tone).

TECHNIQUE: THE DOUBLE REVERSAL

At the realization stage, you can use this technique, which consists of giving a realization to both the hero and the adversary. Each character learns something from the other, and instead of a single vision, the audience receives two different perspectives on the appropriate way to act and live in the world.

Here's how to create a double reversal:

1. Give the hero and his main adversary a weakness and a need (the hero's and adversary's weaknesses and needs do not have to be identical or even similar).

2. Make the adversary human: make him capable of learning and changing.

3. During the confrontation, or just after, give a realization to both the hero and the adversary.

4. Connect the two realizations: the hero must learn something from the adversary and the adversary must learn something from the hero.

5. Your moral viewpoint will correspond to the best of what both characters have learned.

CASABLANCA

- Psychological Realization: Rick reconnects with his idealism and gains a clear vision of who he truly is.

- Moral Realization: Rick realizes he must sacrifice himself to save Ilsa and Laszlo and that he must join the fight for freedom.

- Double Reversal: Renault announces that he too has become a patriot and will accompany Rick on his new path.

TOOTSIE

- Psychological Realization: Michael realizes he has never truly fallen in love because he has never looked beyond a woman's physical attributes.

- Moral Realization: He understands that he has suffered from his arrogance and disdain towards women, and that he has made the women around him suffer. He tells Julie that he has learned more about what makes a man by living in a woman's skin than he ever learned by living in a man's skin.

21. Moral Decision

Once the hero has understood, through his realization, how he should act, he must make a decision. The moral decision is the moment when the hero chooses between two ways of acting, each representing a set of values and a lifestyle that impacts others.

The moral decision is proof of what the hero has learned during the realization stage. By taking this action, the hero shows the audience what he has become.

CASABLANCA

Rick gives Laszlo the letters of transit, urges Ilsa to leave with him, and tells Laszlo that Ilsa loves him. Then he leaves to risk his life as a freedom fighter.

TOOTSIE

Michael sacrifices his job and apologizes to Julie and Les for lying to them.

TECHNIQUE: THEMATIC REVELATION

In Chapter 5, "The Moral Debate," we presented thematic revelation as a revelation that affects not the hero but the audience. The audience understands how people in general should live and behave. The thematic revelation allows the story to go beyond the limits of its simple characters to touch the audience in their own way of living.

Many authors prefer to leave aside this very elaborate technique, fearing to appear moralizing in the last moment they share with the audience. However, when well executed, the thematic revelation technique can have a profound impact.

KEY POINT: The trick is to draw the abstract and general from the concrete and particular of your characters. Try to find a specific action or gesture that could have a symbolic impact on the audience.

PLACES IN THE HEART

(Robert Benton, 1984)

A brilliant example of thematic revelation is found at the end of Places in the Heart, the story of a woman, played by Sally Field, in 1930s Midwest America, whose sheriff husband is accidentally killed by a drunken black boy. The boy is lynched by Ku Klux Klan men, who then expel a black man who had helped the widow manage her farm. In a subplot, a man has an affair with his best friend's wife.

The film's final scene takes place in a church. As the preacher talks about the power of love, the wronged woman takes her husband's hand for the first time since she learned of his affair, and he feels the irresistible power of forgiveness. People take communion, one after the other. Each time a person drinks the wine, the preacher says: "The peace of Christ." Each of the story's characters drinks the communion wine. And slowly, the audience has an astonishing thematic revelation. The banker, who was one of the heroine's adversaries, drinks. The black man, who was expelled—and who has long since disappeared from the story—also drinks. The character played by Sally Field drinks. Sitting behind her, her late husband drinks. And next to him, the black boy who killed him and paid for it with his own life also drinks. "The peace of Christ."

From a realistic portrait of the characters, the scene gradually becomes a moment of universal forgiveness, shared by the audience. Its impact is profound. Do not shy away from this excellent technique for fear of seeming pretentious. Take a chance. Do it. Tell a great story.

22. New Balance

Once the desire and need have been fulfilled (or not, which is tragic), things return to normal. But there is nevertheless a big difference from the beginning: thanks to his realization, the hero has risen to a higher level or fallen lower.

CASABLANCA

Rick has regained his idealism and sacrificed his love for a nobler cause.

TOOTSIE

Michael has learned to be honest and less selfish. Telling the truth has allowed him to reconcile with Julie and start a true love story.

The twenty-two steps are powerful tools that give you the ability to create a detailed and organic plot. But know that it takes practice to learn to master them. We therefore advise you to apply them to everything you can write and everything you can read, keeping in mind two essential points:

1. Stay flexible. The twenty-two steps have no clearly defined chronological order. They are not a ready-made formula that allows you to make your story conform. These steps are presented here in the order in which humans generally go through them to solve their problems. But every problem is unique. And every story is unique. Use the twenty-two steps as the framework for the organic unfolding of your unique story, dealing with unique characters trying to solve unique problems.

2. Be careful when changing the order of these steps. This second warning contradicts the first, but it also relies on the fact that these steps are presented in the order in which humans go through them to solve their problems. These twenty-two steps represent an organic order, the development of an individual unit. Thus, if you try to change this order too drastically to appear original or to be surprising, you risk creating a story that will seem false or artificial.

SEQUENCE OF TWISTS-REVELATIONS

Good authors know that twists-revelations are the keys to the plot. And that is why it is very important to take the time to separate these twists from the rest of the plot and consider them as individual units. Searching for the sequence of twists-revelations is one of the most useful narrative techniques for the author.

To determine if the sequence of twists-revelations is well constructed, the following criteria must be considered:

1. The sequence must be logical. The twists-revelations must appear in the order in which it is most likely that the hero has them.

2. The sequence must follow an ascending order in terms of intensity, each twist having to be stronger than the one that preceded it. This is not always possible, especially in long stories (it would go against logic). But care must nevertheless be taken to build the story in a generally ascending way, in order to gradually increase the dramatic tension.

3. The twists must also follow one another at an increasingly rapid pace. This also tends to increase the dramatic tension, the surprise effect being thus denser.

The most powerful of all twists is known as the reversal. This twist reverses the meaning of the entire story: the audience suddenly sees all the elements of the plot in a completely different light. In an instant, the entire reality has changed.

This technique is more common in detective stories and thrillers, which is not surprising. In The Sixth Sense, the reversal occurs when the audience discovers that the character played by Bruce Willis was actually dead for most of the story. In The Usual Suspects, the reversal occurs when the audience discovers that the humble Verbal invented the whole story and is actually the terrible adversary, Keyser Söze.

You will notice that in these two films the great reversal occurs at the end of the story. This has the advantage of leaving the audience in a state of shock. And that is the greatest reason for the tremendous success of these two films.

But this technique nevertheless requires some precautions. Because it can reduce the story to a mere vehicle for the plot, and very few stories can withstand such domination of the plot. O. Henry became known for using the reversal technique in his short stories (such as The Gift of the Magi). But these stories have also been criticized for their forced, artificial, and mechanical aspect.

Let's now study the sequences of twists-revelations in stories other than Casablanca and Tootsie.

ALIEN

(original story by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, screenplay by Dan O'Bannon, 1979)

- Modified Desire: Nick still wants to solve the case, but now he is sure of Beth's guilt.

- Modified Motivations: No.

You will notice that in this crime thriller the twists-revelations are increasingly important and get closer and closer to the goal.

THEME OF THE TRAITOR AND THE HERO

(Jorge Luis Borges, 1956)

Borges is one of the few writers who has been able to use great twists-revelations, even in very short stories, without them dominating the fiction at the expense of characters, symbols, the story's universe, and theme. Borges's philosophy as a writer emphasizes learning, or exploration, as a means of escaping a personal and cosmic labyrinth. Borges's twists-revelations therefore have immense thematic power.

Theme of the Traitor and the Hero is a short story almost exclusively composed of twists-revelations. An unnamed storyteller explains that he is writing a story whose details have not yet been revealed to him. His narrator, Ryan, is the great-grandson of Kilpatrick, one of the greatest Irish heroes, a man who was assassinated in a theater on the eve of a victorious revolt.

- Twist-Revelation No. 1: While writing Kilpatrick's biography, Ryan discovers in the police investigation a number of troubling details, such as a letter advising Kilpatrick not to go to the theater, much like the letter that announced Julius Caesar's assassination.

- Twist-Revelation No. 2: Ryan understands that there is a secret form of time in which events and lines are repeated throughout history.
• Twist-revelation no. 3 Ryan learns that the words supposedly spoken by a beggar to Kilpatrick can be found in Macbeth.

• Twist-revelation no. 4 Ryan discovers that Kilpatrick's best friend had translated Shakespeare's plays into Gaelic.

• Twist-revelation no. 5 Ryan learns that Kilpatrick had ordered the execution of a traitor—whose identity is unknown—just days before his death, but this information doesn't seem to fit with Kilpatrick's good character.

• Twist-revelation no. 6 Kilpatrick had entrusted his friend Nolan with the mission to discover who the traitor was, and Nolan found out that the traitor was none other than Kilpatrick himself.

• Twist-revelation no. 7 Nolan devised a plan: Kilpatrick would be dramatically assassinated; by dying a hero, he would trigger the revolt. Kilpatrick agreed to play along.

• Twist-revelation no. 8 With very little time to implement his plan, Nolan borrowed elements from Shakespeare's plays to perfect his project and make it more convincing and dramatic.

• Twist-revelation no. 9 Since the Shakespearean elements are the least dramatic part of the plan, Ryan understands that Nolan used them so that the truth, and Kilpatrick's true identity, would one day be restored. Ryan, the author, is therefore part of Nolan's plan.

• Revelation for the public Ryan refuses to reveal this last discovery and publishes a book glorifying Kilpatrick.

THE NARRATOR

To use a narrator or not: that is the question. It’s one of the most important decisions you’ll have to make as an author. We introduce this topic in relation to the plot because a narrator can radically change the order in which it unfolds. But if you write an organic story, this choice will equally impact how you present your characters.

Therein lies the rub (to extend the Hamlet metaphor a bit further). The narrator technique is one of the most misused because most authors ignore its true value and implications.

The vast majority of stories—films, novels, or popular plays—do not have an identifiable narrator. They are linear stories told by an omniscient narrator. Someone tells the story, but the audience doesn’t know who it is and doesn’t care. Stories of this type almost always have a fast pace, a single strong desire line, and a "big" plot.

A narrator is a person who describes the hero's actions, either in the first person—if they speak about themselves—or in the third—if they speak about someone else. With an identifiable narrator, more complexity and subtlety are allowed. To be very clear, one could say that the narrator allows the hero's actions to be described and commented upon.

From the moment you identify the person telling the story, readers or viewers wonder: "Why is this person telling the story? And why does this story need to be told by a person, now, in front of me?" The narrator thus tends to draw attention to themselves and, at least initially, prompts the audience to take a step back from the story. This gives the author the advantage of detachment.

A narrator also allows the audience to hear the voice of the character telling the story. There are always great debates about the term "voice" as if it were the panacea for telling stories well. When we talk about allowing the audience to hear the character's voice, it's to truly enter the character's mind, at the very moment they speak. This mind is thus expressed in the most precise and unique way possible: what the character talks about and how they say it. If one can enter the character's mind, it means it is a real person, with biases and illusions, even if they themselves are unaware. This character may or may not try to tell the truth to the audience, but whatever truth comes out of their mouth will be highly subjective. These are not the words of God or an omniscient narrator. If we push this logic to the extreme, we can say that the narrator blurs, even destroys, the boundary between reality and illusion.

Another important implication of using a narrator is the notion of memory. Indeed, the narrator recounting what happened in the past immediately brings memory into play. From the moment readers or viewers hear that the story is a memory, they feel a sense of sadness and nostalgia, a regret about "what might have been." They also feel that the story is complete and that the narrator, with the hindsight that can only come at the end, tells it with a bit more wisdom.

Some authors play on these two points—the person directly telling the story to the audience, and presenting it as a memory—to better deceive the reader or viewer by leading them to think that what they are about to hear is reliable. The narrator essentially says: "I was there, I'm going to tell you what really happened. Trust me." For the audience, it's a tacit invitation not to trust and to explore the problem of truth as the story unfolds.

In addition to increasing the problem of truth, the narrator gives the author immense advantages. It helps establish an intimate connection between the character and the audience. It can also make characters more subtle and help distinguish them from one another. Moreover, using a narrator is often a sign of the transition from a hero who acts—generally a warrior—to a hero who creates—an artist. The act of narrating the story becomes the main point, and the path to "immortality" thus shifts from a hero undertaking glorious actions to a narrator who tells them.

As for plot construction, the narrator plays a liberating role. Since the actions of the plot are framed by a person's memories, one can set aside chronology and arrange the actions in the order that is most structurally significant. The narrator can also help the author link actions and events that span a long period of time or a vast space, especially when the hero undertakes a journey. As we have already mentioned, this type of plot often seems fragmented. But framed by a narrator's memories, the actions and events suddenly seem to regain unity, and the wide gaps separating the events of the story suddenly seem to disappear.

Before discussing the best techniques, we will present what must be avoided at all costs. First of all, the narrator should not be used as a mere frame. By this, we mean that the story cannot open with a narrator essentially saying: "I'm going to tell you a story." Then recounting the events of the plot in chronological order, and, at the end, saying: "That's what happened. It was quite an amazing story."

This type of scheme, although quite common, is worse than useless. Not only does it draw attention to the narrator for no reason, but it also fails to take advantage of any of its implications and strengths. The presence of the narrator seems to have the sole function of telling the audience that they should appreciate this story because it is told "artistically."

However, there are a number of techniques that allow for maximizing the possibilities offered by the choice of a narrator. If these techniques are so powerful, it's because they are inherent in the structure of a person who needs to tell a story and a story that needs to be told. But don't imagine that you have to use them all. Each story is different. Choose the techniques that best suit yours.

1. Understand that your narrator will probably be your main character

Whatever form of narration is used—first or third person—nine times out of ten, the true hero of the story is the narrator. And this for structural reasons. Telling the story is equivalent to going halfway through the awareness stage. At the beginning, the narrator looks to the past to try to understand the impact that their actions or those of others have had on them. By describing the actions of another or those they themselves undertook in the past, the narrator glimpses an external pattern of actions and gains a deep and personal thought that changes the course of their life in the present.

2. Introduce the narrator in a dramatic situation

When a fight, for example, has just taken place, or when an important decision must be made. This method allows the narrator to be placed in the story and thus creates suspense around their identity. It also tends to give the narrator's account a quick start.

• Sunset Boulevard: The narrator, Joe Gillis, has just been killed by his mistress, Norma Desmond.

• Raging Bull: The narrator is about to step into the ring, where he will deliberately lose the championship.

• The Usual Suspects: The narrator is probably the sole survivor of a massacre and is being interrogated by the police.

3. Give them a good reason to start telling the story

Rather than simply saying: "I'm going to tell you a story," the narrator must be personally motivated, in the present, by a problem in the story. And this story problem, their personal motivation, must be directly related to the reason that drives them to tell this story at this precise moment.

• Raging Bull: The narrator-hero is a corrupt boxer. He is about to deliberately lose the championship and therefore needs to understand, before the match begins, how he got there.

• The Usual Suspects: The policeman threatens Verbal with being killed if he refuses to talk.

• How Green Was My Valley: The narrator is devastated by the idea of having to leave his beloved valley. Before leaving, he too needs to understand how he got there.

4. Do not make them an omniscient narrator

An omniscient narrator has no dramatic interest in the present. They already know everything that happened and thus become a lifeless frame. On the contrary, the narrator must have a major weakness that they can only overcome by telling the story. The memory and narration of the story must represent a painful experience. Thus, the narrator has dramatic power and is personally interesting in the present, and the act of narrating the story becomes heroic in itself.

• Cinema Paradiso: The hero, Salvatore, is rich and famous, but also sad and unhappy. He has known many women but has never truly loved any. And he hasn't returned to his Sicilian hometown in thirty years. The news of the death of his old friend Alfredo prompts him to remember his childhood in this village where he swore never to return.

• The Shawshank Redemption: Red "Redding," sentenced to life in prison, has just been paroled. He was a man without hope who thought he needed the prison walls to survive. One day Andy arrived. Like every new prisoner, he had to go through the wringer. Red bet that Andy would be the first newcomer to scream that night. But Andy didn't make a sound.

• Heart of Darkness: This is the ultimate detective story where the "crime"—the "horror" of what Kurtz may have done or said—will never be known or solved. Part of the mystery lies in Marlow's true motivations, the reasons that drive him to tell his story over and over again. The answer he gives to Kurtz's "fiancée," when she asks what her beloved's last words were, may be considered a clue. Rather than reporting the last words Kurtz actually uttered before dying—"The horror! The horror!"—Marlow prefers to lie and respond: "The last word he spoke was—your name." Marlow regrets lying to her, giving her a simple answer, and provoking undue emotion in her. And it is his guilt that drives him to tell his story repeatedly, until it is perfect, even though Kurtz's experience, and the heart of darkness itself, will forever remain unknown.

5. Try to find an original structure rather than telling the story in chronological order

The way you tell the story (via the narrator) must be exceptional. Without this, the narrator is just a useless frame. By telling the story in an original way, you justify the use of the narrator, as if to say: this story is so exceptional that it can only be told by an exceptional narrator.

• It's a Wonderful Life: Two angels tell one of their "colleagues" about the past events in the life of a man who is about to commit suicide. The third angel then shows the man in question an alternative present: what the world would have looked like if he had never been born.

• The Usual Suspects: Several people have been murdered on a docked boat. Agent Kujan interrogates a crippled man named Verbal who tells him that the whole story began six weeks earlier when the police questioned six men about a robbery. The story alternates between Verbal's interrogation and the events he describes. After releasing Verbal, Kujan observes the bulletin board in the interrogation room and sees all the names Verbal used in his story. In the present, Verbal invented all the events of the "past." He is both the killer and the narrator.

6. The narrator can try to tell the story in different ways as they strive to discover and express the truth

The story is not a fixed thing, determined from the beginning. It is a dramatic debate between the author and their audience. The act of narrating the story and the act of listening to it, and silently questioning it, must partly determine the fate of the narrative.

The narrator allows this back-and-forth by leaving openings during moments when they hesitate on the best way to tell the story, allowing the audience to fill in the blanks. Despite the difficulties they encounter, the narrator gradually comes to understand the deep meaning of the events, and by exposing them to readers or viewers and involving them, they push them to understand the deep meaning of the events in their own lives.

• Heart of Darkness: This is an anti-narrator story that actually uses three to structurally show that the "true" story is so ambiguous that it can never be narrated. A sailor talks about a narrator (Marlow) who is telling his shipmates a story that was told to him by a man (Kurtz) whose last words, "The horror! The horror!" are never explained. We are literally faced with a mystery wrapped in an enigma, an infinite regression of meaning, as obscure as "the horror" itself.

Moreover, Marlow has told his story many times, as if trying each time to get closer to the truth, but always ending up failing. He explains that he goes up the river to discover the truth about Kurtz, but the closer he gets to him, the more things become obscure.

• The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman: Three hundred years earlier, this method, although applied to a comedy, had already been used in Tristram Shandy. The narrator of this novel tells a story in the first person that goes forward as well as backward. He addresses the reader directly, reproaching them for not reading correctly. And he complains when he has to explain something he would have preferred to keep for later.

7. Do not abandon the narrator's frame at the end of the story, but around its last quarter

If you close the narrator's frame at the very end of the story, the act of remembering and narrating the story may not have a dramatic or structural impact on the present. You need to leave room in the story for the act of recounting the narrator's own change.

• It's a Wonderful Life: Angel Clarence listens to the story of George's life until the moment he is about to end his life. This account of past events occupies about two-thirds of the story. In the last third, Clarence shows George an alternative reality and helps him change.

• Cinema Paradiso: The hero, Salvatore, learns of the death of his friend Alfredo. He thinks back to his childhood, much of which took place at Cinema Paradiso, where Alfredo was the projectionist. The memory ends when Salvatore leaves his hometown to make a name for himself in Rome. The story returns to the present. Salvatore returns to his hometown for the funeral and discovers that Cinema Paradiso has become a ruin. However, Alfredo has left him a gift: a film reel featuring all the great kissing scenes that the priest had ordered to be cut when Salvatore was little.

8. The act of telling the story can lead the narrator to an awareness

By reflecting on the past, the narrator has a great awareness of themselves in the present. Remember that the entire process of narration corresponds structurally to the awareness stage for the narrator. Telling the story is therefore a means for the hero-narrator to fulfill their need.

• The Great Gatsby: Nick says at the end: "That's my Middle West [...]. I'm part of all this, a bit grave because of the feeling those long winters left me [...]. After Gatsby's death, the East was haunted for me like that [...]. That's why when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind began to stretch the damp clothes on the lines, I decided to go home."

• The Shawshank Redemption: Red learns to live with hope and freedom thanks to the inspiring example of his friend Andy.

• Goodfellas: This dark comedy uses first-person narration to emphasize the ironic fact that the hero has not had an awareness at the end of the story, even though it was perfectly clear that he should have had one.

9. Push the narrator to reflect on the immoral or destructive aspect that the act of telling the story may have, for themselves or others

This technique makes narration a moral problem in itself, interesting in the present from a dramatic point of view.

• Copenhagen: This story is a true competition of narrators: three characters present a different version of the facts that occurred when they met during World War II to discuss building a nuclear bomb. Each story represents a different viewpoint on morality, and each character uses their own story to attack the morality of the other.

10. The act of telling the story can provoke a final dramatic event

This event often corresponds to the hero's moral decision.

The narration of the story must have consequences, the most dramatic being that the hero-narrator is forced to make a moral decision based on their awareness.

• The Great Gatsby: Nick decides to leave the moral decadence of New York to return to the Midwest.

• It's a Wonderful Life: George decides not to commit suicide and to reunite with his family.

• Raging Bull: The narrator-hero, after reflecting on the past, decides not to deliberately lose the fight.

• The Shawshank Redemption: Red decides not to give up after leaving prison like his friend Brooks did. He decides to live fully and join Andy, who has started a new life in Mexico.

11. Do not fall into the trap of believing that a character's death allows for knowing their true story

This is a very common trigger: the narrator claims that since the character is dead, it is finally possible to tell the truth about them. The scene of their death and last words is presented as the key that allows the truth to finally "be restored."

This is a very bad technique. It is not your death that allows you to better understand your life by finally seeing it as a whole. It is acting as if you were going to die that creates meaning by pushing you to make choices here and now. Giving meaning to your life is a continuous process.

Similarly, the narrator can use the character's death (their own or someone else's) to give the impression that, from now on, the story can finally be told and understood in its entirety. But meaning comes from the act of narrating the story, reflecting on the past, over and over, and each time, the "true" story is different. In accordance with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the narrator can know a meaning at a given moment, but never the meaning.

• Citizen Kane: The meaning of Kane's last word, "Rosebud," is not that it sums up the hero's life, but that it cannot.

• Heart of Darkness: Kurtz's last words—"The horror! The horror!"—do not make the enigma of life easier to understand. It is the final mystery of a larger mystery concerning the heart of darkness that exists in every human being, including the narrator, Marlow, who tells the story over and over in a vain attempt to finally discover the truth.

12. The deep theme of the story must relate to the truth and beauty of creativity, and not to the heroism of actions

By placing all actions within the framework of narration and emphasizing the importance of the narrator's difficulties in describing these actions, you make narration the essential action and the great achievement of the story.

• The Usual Suspects: Verbal is an expert criminal who has beaten or killed everyone who tried to stop him. But his greatest achievement—which is also the main reason for his success as a criminal—is the story he improvises that makes everyone think he is a weak and pathetic man.

• Gilgamesh: Gilgamesh is a great warrior. But when his friend and comrade-in-arms dies, he seeks immortality in vain. This immortality is ultimately achieved by telling his story.

• The Shawshank Redemption: The greatest gift Andy gave to his friend Red (the narrator) and the other prisoners is showing them that one could live with hope, style, and freedom, even in prison.

13. Beware of too many narrators
Despite all these advantages, the narrator also has weaknesses. His greatest flaw is that he places a frame between the story and the audience, which usually tends to diminish the emotional impact of the story. The more narrators there are, the more likely the reader or viewer is to take a step back, to the point where they may end up viewing the story with a cold and distant eye.

Among the stories that excel in the use of the narrator are Sunset Boulevard; The Conformist; American Beauty; The Usual Suspects; Goodfellas; The Shawshank Redemption; Forrest Gump; Presumed Innocent; The Magnificent Ambersons; Heart of Darkness; The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman; Copenhagen; Madame Bovary; Citizen Kane; How Green Was My Valley; Cinema Paradiso; Gilgamesh; The Great Gatsby; Life Is Beautiful; and Blood and Gold.

GENRES

Genre is another structural element that can impact the plot. A genre is a form of story, a particular type of story. In films, novels, and plays, most stories are based on at least one genre, but more often on a combination of two or three. It is therefore important to know which form of story, if any, you will use. Each genre includes predetermined plot highlights that you must include in your story to avoid disappointing the audience.

Genres are true subsystems of the story. Each genre goes through the universal stages of narrative structure, the seven key steps and the twenty-two steps, and executes them differently. It is perfectly possible to tell a great story without relying on any genre. But if you wish to use one, you must master how it executes the structural steps and know the particular way it handles characters, theme, the story world, and symbols. Then you must use these elements in an original way so that your story does not resemble all other stories in the genre, even if in many respects, it will resemble all other stories in the genre. The audience for genre stories likes to recognize the familiar framework of the form under a new skin that gives the story its freshness.

The details of the various genres are beyond the scope of this book, and we have already written extensively on this subject in other works. Each genre is very complex, and one must fully immerse oneself in one or two of them if one wishes to have a chance of using them effectively. The good news is that with a little practice, as all good authors know, one can perfectly learn to master them.

CREATE YOUR PLOT – WRITING EXERCISE NO. 7

• Guiding Principle and Plot Review the guiding principle and theme of your story. Ensure that your plot follows these two lines.

• Symbols and Plot If you are using a story of symbols, ensure that your plot is indeed an expression of it.

• Narrator Determine whether or not you wish to use a narrator. If so, choose a type of narrator and keep in mind the structural techniques that allow you to make the most of using this narrator.

• Twenty-two Steps Describe in detail the twenty-two steps of your story. Start with step no. 1, the plot framework, so that all other steps naturally fall into place.

• Sequence of Twists-Revelations Focus on the sequence of twists-revelations. Establish a list of the different twists independently of the other steps of the story. To make these twists as dramatic as possible, follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure that the sequence seems logical.

2. Try to make each twist more intense than the one before it.

3. Check that each twist forces your hero to modify their original desire in some way.

4. Keep in mind that the closer you get to the end of the story, the faster the twists should follow one another.

We will now dissect a well-known story, The Godfather, and determine its twenty-two steps so that you understand how they can add decisive details to the seven key structural steps we have already determined.

THE GODFATHER

(Novel by Mario Puzo, screenplay by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, 1972)

• Hero Michael Corleone

1. AWARENESS, NEED, AND DESIRE

• Awareness Michael has no awareness. He has become a ruthless killer, but only his wife, Kay, notices his moral decline.

• Need Avoid becoming a ruthless killer.

• Desire Avenge the men who shot his father.

• Initial Error Michael thinks he is different from the other members of his family and that he is above criminal activity.

2. GHOST AND STORY WORLD

• Ghost Michael's ghost is not an event from the past but a family legacy of crime and murders that he deeply despises.

• Story World The story world is the mafia system of Michael's family. It is an extremely hierarchical world, run in a military fashion, with strict rules. The Godfather, the absolute ruler, dispenses justice as he sees fit, and the family uses murder to get what it wants. The workings of this world are exposed during the wedding of Michael's sister, to which all the characters in the story have been invited, including the hidden adversary, Barzini.

The national scope of the family's power is then exposed when a Hollywood producer refuses to do what the Godfather asked. When the man wakes up, he discovers that the head of his favorite horse has been cut off and placed on his bed.

3. WEAKNESS AND NEED

• Weaknesses Michael is young, inexperienced, overconfident, and has yet to prove himself.

• Psychological Need Michael must overcome his superiority complex and dogmatism.

• Moral Need He must avoid becoming ruthless, like all other Mafia leaders, while continuing to protect his family.

• Problem Members of a rival gang shoot Michael's father, the head of the family.

4. INCITING EVENT

The distance separating Michael from the rest of his family disappears when he reads that his father has been shot.

5. DESIRE

Avenge the men who shot his father, and thereby protect his family.

6. ALLY(IES)

Michael has a wide range of allies within his family: his father, Don Corleone; his brothers, Sonny and Fredo; Tom; Clemenza; and his wife, Kay.

7. OPPONENT / MYSTERY

Michael's first opponent is Sollozzo. However, his main opponent is the more powerful Barzini, who is actually the mastermind behind Sollozzo and seeks to annihilate the entire Corleone family. Michael and Barzini clash over the survival of the Corleone family and fight for control of organized crime in New York.

8. FALSE ALLY

Michael has an unusually large number of false allies, which tends to significantly flesh out the plot. There is the car driver when his father is shot; the Sicilian bodyguard, Fabrizio, who tries to kill him but only succeeds in blowing up the car with his wife inside; his brother-in-law, Carlo, who will cause Sonny's death; and Tessio, who eventually joins Barzini's camp.

9. FIRST TWIST-REVELATION AND DECISION: MODIFICATION OF DESIRE AND MOTIVATIONS

• Twist-Revelation The hospital where Michael's father is has no guard and is literally empty. Michael realizes that men are about to come and kill his father.

• Decision He decides to protect his father by moving his bed to another room, where he will stay to keep watch.

• Modified Desire Michael no longer seeks to distance himself from his family; he now wants to protect his father and save his family.

• Modified Motivations Michael deeply loves his family and will now put his competitive and success-driven nature at its service.

10. PLAN

Michael's first plan is to kill Sollozzo and his protector, the police captain. His second plan, towards the end of the story, is to kill all the heads of the other mafia families at once.

11. PLAN AND MAIN COUNTERATTACK OF THE OPPONENT

Michael's main opponent is Barzini. His plan is to use Sollozzo as a henchman to kill Don Corleone. Once Don Corleone is out of the picture, he bribes Carlo to lure Sonny into a trap and pays Michael's bodyguard in Sicily to kill him.

12. NARRATIVE DRIVE

• Stages of Drive

1. Clemenza explains to Michael how to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey.

2. At the restaurant, Michael shoots Sollozzo and McCluskey.

3. A quick montage shows newspaper articles.

4. Sonny and Tom argue because Sonny wants to kill old Tattaglia.

5. In Sicily, Michael sees a pretty girl by the roadside and tells his father he would like to meet her.

6. Michael meets Apollonia.

7. Sonny notices Connie has a black eye. In a street, he beats up her husband, Carlo.

8. Michael and Apollonia get married.

9. Tom refuses to give Kay's letter to Michael.

10. Michael teaches Apollonia to drive; he learns of Sonny's death.

• Additional Twist-Revelation On a Sicilian road, Michael sees a beautiful Italian woman.

• Decision He decides to meet her.

• Modified Desire He wants this young woman.

• Modified Motivations He falls in love.

13. ATTACK FROM AN ALLY

• Ally's Criticism When Michael returns from Sicily, Kay reproaches him for working for his father. She tells him he's not like that.

• Hero's Justification He promises her that his family will be completely "legit" in five years.

14. APPARENT DEFEAT

Michael's apparent defeat is a "double blow." He discovers that his brother has been murdered, and immediately after, sees his wife die in an explosion meant for him.

15. SECOND TWIST-REVELATION AND DECISION: OBSESSIONAL DRIVE, MODIFICATION OF DESIRE AND MOTIVATIONS

• Twist-Revelation Michael realizes his car has been rigged with explosives and his wife is about to start it.

• Decision He tries to stop his wife, but it's too late.

• Modified Desire Michael wants to return to his family.

• Obsessional Drive He is determined to avenge the men who killed his wife and brother.

• Modified Motivations He wants to make them pay for killing the people he loved.

16. REVELATION FOR THE AUDIENCE

The audience sees Luca Brasi, Don Corleone's most dangerous ally, being murdered during a meeting with Tattaglia and Sollozzo.

17. THIRD TWIST-REVELATION AND DECISION

• Twist-Revelation Michael discovers that Tessio has switched sides and that Barzini plans to assassinate him.

• Decision He decides to strike first.

• Modified Desire He wants to eliminate all his enemies at once.

• Modified Motivations He wants to win the war once and for all.

18. NARROW DOOR, CAUDINE FORKS, AND ENCOUNTER WITH DEATH

Michael, being a very skilled fighter who even manages to deceive the audience, will not pass through the narrow door or under the Caudine Forks before the final battle. His encounter with death is that of his wife dying in an explosion meant for him.

19. FINAL CONFRONTATION

The final confrontation is presented as an alternating montage between Michael's presence at his nephew's baptism and the murder of the heads of the five Mafia families. At the baptism, Michael says he believes in God. Clemenza shoots men coming out of an elevator with a shotgun. Moe Green is shot in the eye. Michael, in accordance with the baptismal liturgy, renounces Satan. Another man shoots one of the Mafia chiefs between the panes of a revolving door. Barzini is assassinated. Tom prepares to kill Tessio. Michael has Carlo strangled.

20. AWARENESS

• Psychological Awareness There is none. Michael still believes his sense of superiority and dogmatism are justified.

• Moral Awareness There is none. Michael has become a ruthless killer. The screenwriters used a very studied narrative structure technique by giving the awareness to the hero's wife, Kay, who sees what her husband has become as the door closes in her face.

21. MORAL DECISION

Michael's major moral decision occurs just before the confrontation when he decides to kill all his rivals, as well as his brother-in-law, after becoming the godfather of the latter's baby.

22. NEW EQUILIBRIUM

Michael has killed his enemies and "risen" to the position of Godfather. But from a moral standpoint, he has fallen and become "the devil himself." This man who once wanted nothing to do with his family's violence and crimes has become its leader and will kill anyone who tries to betray or hinder him.

QUESTIONS / ANSWERS

Q: What are the main mistakes authors make regarding their plot?

A: The biggest problem for most writers is that they don't know how to create an interconnected and growing plot.

The plot is the sequence of events through which the hero tries to defeat the opponent and achieve the goal. It is what makes the internal development of the character enjoyable for the audience. It is the trick that distinguishes your story, telling the audience that you are a true storyteller.

Q: What causes this difficulty in creating the plot?

A: If most writers struggle to create their plot, it's because they think tactically instead of strategically. Certainly, you need to know specific plot techniques, the tactics that allow you to create a moment of conflict or a scene that will pay off. But a good plot is a strategy, a pattern of interconnections that the author develops to constantly pressure the hero and relentlessly attack them.

When writers have plot problems, it's almost always because they lack this overall strategic vision. They view opposition tactically, scene by scene, little piece by little piece. They see opposition as a series of isolated obstacles the hero must overcome along a path.

But this is not surprising. Because it is not easy to explain how to create a complex and interconnected strategy. Those who teach writing, myself included, generally describe opposition in distinct units. The guidelines are usually focused on the moment of attack, which is important. But these close-ups on particular points tend to complicate the author's task when it comes to understanding how to create their plot.

Q: Can you give an example of this tactical approach?

A: One of the techniques I mentioned for comedy is to place the hero in their worst nightmare. Determine the worst thing that could happen to your character and force them to endure it. The idea is to batter the hero, torture them, put maximum pressure on them.

TOOTSIE

Earlier in this chapter, we studied different moments when Michael, the hero of Tootsie, is battered by various opponents. Each of these moments is a mini-nightmare for this particular hero, a macho actor so obsessed with finding work that he has come to disguise himself as a woman.

At the first audition, for example, the director, who is also macho, rejects Michael because he, or rather she, is not pretty enough for the role.

Michael falls for Julie, one of the actresses in the series, but he can't try to seduce her because to keep his role he must maintain his disguise.

Julie's father, Les, falls in love with Michael as a woman and declares his feelings.

These are all moments that are funny in themselves. But what distinguishes Tootsie is that the screenwriters have connected these individual attacks to a larger strategy, or plot, to put maximum pressure on the hero.

Q: Are there other technical means to create moments of conflict?

A: The other technique for creating individual moments of opposition is the one imagined by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park and The Book of Mormon. Instead of bringing in the next plot element by thinking "Yes, and then...", the author should think "Yes, but..." The hero takes a step towards the goal but immediately encounters a new obstacle that diverts them from their path or sets them back.

These two techniques are useful for authors to understand the tactics of a moment or a striking plot element. But if they are not integrated into a broader strategy of interconnections, they can very well undermine your plot.

Q: How can the tactical approach undermine the plot?

A: By thinking in terms of individual moments of opposition, one can easily fall into the two greatest sins of plotting:

1. episodic plot

2. repetition of the same highlight.

An episodic plot is a plot where individual events stand out but are not connected and do not grow beneath the surface.

Repetition of the same highlight means that events are superficially different but fundamentally identical. Instead of plot development, you get plot repetition.

These errors can only come from a hero facing a series of unrelated obstacles, making it impossible to build a growing plot.

Q: At what exact point in the twenty-two steps can this problem occur?

A: When using the twenty-two steps, this difficulty in creating the plot is perceived from step 4, the inciting event, to step 19, the final confrontation. But the step where the problem becomes more evident and more common is step 12, the narrative drive, and step 15, the obsessional drive, where the hero undertakes a number of actions to achieve the goal. In narrative drive and obsessional drive, the problem stems notably from two sources:

1. The hero undertakes actions that do not respond to those of the opponent, and vice versa. In other words, there is no series of attacks and counterattacks between the hero and their opponents. A series of attacks and counterattacks can only occur if each character reacts to the other's actions.

2. The actions the hero takes to achieve the goal, although different in appearance, are fundamentally identical.

In a love story, for example, the hero and the loved one may meet on various dates – restaurant, museum, beach – which, although they take place in different locations, fundamentally correspond to the same plot event.

Q: How can the author think strategically about their plot?

A: To fully understand the strategy of the plot, one must start by looking at what the verb "to plot" means: to create a scheme or secret plan to achieve a goal. In a story, the plot is the scheme the author devises to make their hero go through the worst time of their life. But this scheme must remain a secret that neither the characters nor the audience should know.

To devise this scheme, and for the causal relationships between the events of the story to become very complex, you must understand that you are working within the vast system of character development. You cannot simply dismantle the system to try to understand its connections; you would only get spare parts.

Q: How to build this "vast" plot?

A: To build this vast plot, the author's scheme, two major sequences of causality must be intertwined.

1. The attack and counterattack between the hero and the opponents as they try to achieve the goal.

2. A sequence of revealing information through which the author explains, sometimes lying, who does what to whom.

These two sequences of causality – how the hero acts and what they learn – drive the evolution of the story. To weave these two sequences throughout the story to make it a vast plot, you must consider the plot as a complete network of conflicting actions and information.

In a way, one could say that every good plot resembles a detective story. The author has devised a complex but secret scheme. They deliberately play at revealing and concealing information from the characters and the reader. The author is the killer who leaves behind a trail of clues to mislead until the most dramatic moment. The reader or viewer, and at least one of the characters, are the detectives trying to discover the truth, the real connections, hidden beneath the structure the author has presented to them.

Q: What are the elements of a good plot?

A: There are many, as it is an ambitious project, but I think three stand out particularly:

1. A good plot is linked from the first sentence to the last, from the inciting event to the final action. But the way the plot is linked should not be clear to the reader until the last sentence, ideally, in any case, not until the very end of the story. This last sentence should contain a twist-revelation that, for the first time, exposes to the reader the true connections of the plot in its entirety.

By keeping this huge twist secret until the very end of the story, the author creates an explosion, an orgasm of understanding, which is both intellectually pleasing, the beauty of the construction inspiring admiration, and emotionally touching, by the transformation this insight produces on the characters' lives.

2. A good plot has a sequence of causal connections linking the characters' actions. Nothing is left to chance. It is the opposite of the episodic plot, which most often occurs when the hero goes on a journey during which individual events occur, but without being connected to each other, which tends to prevent growing development.
Moreover, the best journey plots, like good stories of wandering knights, are only seemingly random and episodic. As Erich Auerbach writes in "Mimesis," his fundamental work on narration, the knight encounters obstacles as if on an assembly line. The author specifically designs these obstacles for this particular character, relying on his greatest flaws, so that he is inexorably led, if capable, to evolve and gain enlightenment.

3. A good plot is not a plot for the sake of plot, a vast scheme aimed solely at deceiving the audience and showcasing the author's talent for creating puzzles. A good plot always serves the characters. It is a process of actions designed to create a process within the characters.

I would go so far as to say that you cannot create good characters without testing them with a good plot. It is only by facing the challenges of intense conflict and complex plot that the character can reach their best self or, in case of failure, present to the audience, through profound and emotional means, what their life could have been.

Q: Can you give some techniques for creating a good plot?

A: I will give you four:

TECHNIQUE 1: NARRATIVE DYNAMISM IN THE PLOT

Narrative dynamism, which is the basis of popular stories (page-turners), simply relies on a plot with maximum speed and urgency. It stems from four major narrative elements:

1. The hero trying to fulfill their desire.

2. The amount of conflict between the hero and all their adversaries.

3. The number of high points—twists or major actions—in the story.

4. The pace of the high points; in other words, their acceleration as the story approaches its end.

TECHNIQUE 2: ENRICHING THE PLOT BY ADDING REVERSIBLE CHARACTERS

Reversible characters are characters who change roles in the story. They can be false allies or false adversaries.

False ally: A character who seems to help the hero achieve their goal but is actually an enemy trying to prevent them.

False adversary: A character who seems to prevent the hero from achieving their goal but is actually a friend.

If these characters are so useful for enriching the plot, it is because every time one of them changes sides, it is a twist-revelation for the hero and/or the audience. To simplify: plot = twists-revelations. So, the more reversible characters you have, within reason, the more enriched your plot will be.

THE "HARRY POTTER" SERIES (novels by J. K. Rowling, with the first published in 1997)

To illustrate the importance of reversible characters in creating the plot, let's study the most popular stories of all time, those of Harry Potter. The challenge presented by their plot for the author, J. K. Rowling, was not insignificant: to create a plot that would extend over seven books!

One of the best techniques she used to meet this challenge was to include several reversible characters, the most remarkable being Severus Snape.

Snape constantly shifts from false adversary to false ally, and vice versa, throughout the seven novels.

Professor Quirrell - false ally

Sirius Black - false adversary

Peter Pettigrew - false ally

Mad-Eye Moody - false ally

TECHNIQUE 3: STARTING WITH THE ADVERSARY'S PLAN

I teach plot using what I believe to be the most powerful tools: the twenty-two steps of any good story. By using the twenty-two steps (the seven main ones, plus the fifteen that help you develop the middle of your story), you will inevitably get a good plot. Why? Because the twenty-two steps allow you to outline the overall strategy of your plot, consisting of the sequence of conflicts and the sequence of twists-revelations of your particular story.

Step 11, the adversary's plan, though little known, is one of the most important keys to a good plot. Just as the hero has a plan to defeat the adversary and achieve the goal, the adversary has a plan to defeat the hero and achieve the goal.

KEY POINT: The more developed the adversary's plan, the stronger the plot will be. Or more precisely, the more ingenious the adversary's plan, the stronger the plot will be.

This brings us to what we believe to be the best technique of all regarding plot: to determine the "vast" plot of the story, start by determining the adversary's plan.

It is often said that the hero must lead the action. This is generally true. But if, at the start, you try to build the plot based on this rule, you will likely end up with a very weak plot. Why? Because the hero, after a few active steps, will achieve the goal too easily, without surprise for the audience.

It is better to start by determining how the adversary will deploy their forces and use cunning to defeat the hero. This will provide you with various attacks that will push the hero back and force them to react. It will also provide you with various twists-revelations: the hero will discover, one by one, the traps the adversary has set for them.

Plot = sequence of conflicts + sequence of twists-revelations

TECHNIQUE 4: SEQUENCE OF CONFLICTS ATTACKS/COUNTER-ATTACKS

We mentioned earlier that the biggest problem authors face regarding plot construction is related to a mistake: tactical thinking, focused on the single obstacle the hero must overcome, rather than strategic thinking, encompassing the sequence of conflicts and the sequence of twists-revelations that are connected and crescendo throughout the story. Some authors make this mistake from the inciting event to the end of their story.

However, in general, this big plot problem occurs more in the middle of the story, during the narrative dynamism stage. Dynamism corresponds to the series of actions the hero undertakes to achieve the goal and, in terms of page quantity, it is the most important stage of the entire story.

KEY POINT: To avoid this problem, ensure that the adversary's attacks occur in response to the hero's actions, and vice versa.

You will thus obtain an interconnected and growing sequence of attacks/counter-attacks that will extend throughout the middle of the story. The hero and the adversaries are organically linked in a global conflict sequence, and the plot develops without repeating itself (thus avoiding the episodic plot or one that repeats the same high points).

Q: Why doesn't the "three-act structure" work for plot?

A: Proponents of the "three-act structure" think in terms of "plot points" that should appear two or three times in a feature film script. The result is a plot far, very far from the density and complexity required in the intrigue-heavy world of genre-based films.

Let's be clear about this: these two or three plot points are simply ridiculous. It's a beginner's method; those who use it have no chance of writing or selling a feature film.

By writing a script with only two or three plot points, you create all sorts of problems for your story. You deprive yourself of having a plot in the middle of your story, the place where it is most difficult but also most important to create intrigue. And by doing so, you place yourself far, very far outside the realm of professional writing.

If scriptwriters using the "three-act" structure have so many problems with plot, it's partly because the expression they rely on, the "plot point," is so broad that it almost becomes meaningless. It doesn't allow for an understanding of what actually happens when the plot "bounces."

Q: But then, what is this "plot point" they refer to?

A: A plot point is either a major attack or a twist. Once this definition is established, it's easy to understand that you need far more plot points than the two or three found in scripts written on a three-act structure. Let's focus for a moment on the twists:

KEY POINT: A densely plotted film contains, depending on its story and genre, between seven and ten major twists. A densely plotted novel contains three to five times more. "David Copperfield," for example, includes more than sixty twists.

Q: American films seem artificial because they have too many twists. Does too much plot kill the plot?

A: In theory, yes, but to write something popular, we should all try to have this problem.

The real reason why too many twists give some films an artificial aspect is that screenwriters do not derive the plot from the character. It's plot for the sake of plot. Screenwriters simply twist the hero's mind, and the audience's, over and over, to make the puzzle as complicated as possible. The characters are just pawns.

The audience ends up refusing to get involved in the story because they perceive the mechanics of the plot as well as the heavy hand of the author. But worse: too much plot—a plot that does not derive from the character—tends to annihilate emotion, not only in the characters but also in the spectators.

To write a good story, you must find a balance between plot and characters. Once again, a plot without character is a puzzle. A character without plot is a drug. You need no more and no less than the amount of plot your character deserves.

Let's now turn to popular storytelling. If we said that we should all try to have this problem of excess plot, it's because the vast majority of authors struggle to imagine even the thinnest of plots, that is, a plot with only two or three twists. In the context of the global storytelling market, increasingly plot-rich across all mediums, these authors have no chance.

Popular storytelling is almost exclusively genre-based. Genres are actually specialized plot forms, and they have been written, rewritten, and perfected for so long that they have become relatively dense plot forms. One tends to fit as much plot as possible into a genre story.

All genre stories are fundamentally artificial in some respects. And in some cases, like romantic comedy, extremely artificial. If you decide to embark on genre storytelling, you must therefore accept a certain artificiality. Notably, more twists than would occur in "real life."

But this is not an excuse to write genre stories that seem artificial. Quite the opposite. Your task is to transcend the genre so that the artificial form seems real, original, and organic, with a plot that appears to derive from the characters.

TECHNIQUE: THE SIMPLE SEVEN-STEP PLOT

You can and should determine the basic plot of your story by starting with the seven steps. The plot thus defined will constitute a sound structure on which you can build all the elements that make a good story. In other words, the seven steps provide you with a plot that is not only surprising but also has structural foundations that will have strong emotional repercussions on the characters and the audience.

But for a good plot, you will need much more than seven steps, especially in the middle of the story.

Q: How do you move from a good seven-step plot to a super twenty-two-step plot?

A: To achieve this, you need to carefully study the additional steps, notably the adversary's plan, narrative dynamism, apparent defeat, and twists-revelations. We have already discussed the adversary's plan and dynamism, which provide the sequence of conflicts. Let's now focus on the very important twists-revelations.

TECHNIQUE 5: TWISTS-REVELATIONS

During a twist-revelation, the hero obtains new information that prompts them to make a decision and change the course of their actions. We can talk about a twist-revelation or a surprise. Now, surprise is what the audience loves most in a story.

Coupled with a major attack, the twist-revelation corresponds to the moment when the plot "bounces."

KEY POINT: The twist-revelation is the most important element of a good plot and is the best way to increase narrative dynamism.

For a good plot, you will need more twists-revelations occurring at a faster pace as you approach the end of the story. This is another key to achieving strong narrative dynamism and creating the vortex, or whirlwind, where everything accelerates as the story approaches its end.

Q: How do you create twists?

A: Here are five tips:

1. Assign secrets to each of the major characters, especially all the adversaries.

2. Make the adversaries cunning, not only in the plan they implement but also in the way they attack.

KEY RULE: The more the adversaries use deception, the stronger the plot will be.

3. Include a number of false allies and false adversaries.

Every time one of them changes sides, it constitutes a twist.

4. The best twists are those concerning the actions taken by the adversary to defeat the hero. The adversary hides their attack. The hero and the audience say: "I thought they were using this tactic, but in fact, it's that one." This forces the hero to adapt and counterattack.

5. The most moving twists are those that occur when there is betrayal.

This is why false allies are more useful than false adversaries: the hero discovers that a close and trusted friend is actually working for the opposing side.

This results in a twist with maximum emotional impact.

THE GODFATHER

1. Sollozzo pretends to be the sole enemy of Don Corleone. Barzini pretends to be the Don's friend and conciliator.

2. Barzini pushes Sollozzo to launch an attack against Don Corleone. They bribe the Don's driver to assassinate him. They bribe the police to get rid of the guards watching his hospital room and try to finish their job. They bribe Michael's bodyguards to try to kill him by blowing up his car. They trap Luca Brasi and kill him. They pay Carlo to beat up Connie, a decoy that lures Sonny out of the den, allowing them to kill him. They get Tessio to arrange a meeting with Michael, during which they plan to assassinate him.

3. There are four false allies in the story: the Don's driver, Michael's Sicilian bodyguards, his brother-in-law Carlo, and one of the family's top lieutenants, Tessio.

4. Michael realizes that Sollozzo has gotten rid of the guards watching his father's hospital room just minutes before the assassins arrive to kill the Don.

5. Michael discovers that the family's loyal lieutenant, Tessio, wishes to help Barzini kill him.

6. Michael discovers that his own brother-in-law, Carlo, had Sonny assassinated.

TECHNIQUE 6: THE SEQUENCE OF TWISTS-REVELATIONS

A good plot consists of two causal sequences: the actions that the hero and the opponents undertake as they vie for the goal (the sequence of conflicts) and the twists-revelations that the hero and the audience discover during the confrontation.

Q: How do you create a strong sequence of twists-revelations?

A: To achieve this, you must go through these five steps:

1. Write the list of scenes, or list of events, for the entire story.

Describe each scene, or event, in one sentence.

Tip: This list should include the actions of the hero and the adversaries attacking each other, as well as all the twists-revelations.

2. Create a separate list for the twists-revelations.

This list will include only the twists-revelations. It will be your sequence of twists-revelations and will be highly useful to you.

3. Study your sequence of twists-revelations to determine if, in general, the movement is increasing.

It is not necessary for each twist-revelation to be more powerful than the one that preceded it. But, in general, there should be an increase.

4. Try to accelerate the pace of the twists-revelations as you approach the eye of the vortex at the end of your story.

5. Don't hesitate to experiment, that is, to change the order of the twists-revelations to determine what will have the most dramatic impact on the audience.

DEFENDING JACOB (Novel by William Landay, 2012)

Premise: A prosecutor investigates the murder of a 14-year-old boy, of which his own son, Jacob, is suspected.

Sequence of twists-revelations:

1. Revelation to the reader: After the events of the story, the prosecutor is questioned before a jury.

2. The prosecutor discovers that the murdered boy was bullying his son, Jacob.

3. Jacob is suspected of the murder.

4. Jacob displays a knife at school.

5. The prosecutor finds the knife and makes it disappear.

6. Jacob is not very popular.

7. Revelation to the reader: The prosecutor's father was convicted of murder.

8. On vacation, a girl Jacob knows disappears.

9. The prosecutor's wife—Jacob's mother—finds red stains on her son's shirt. She now knows he committed a murder.

THE GENRE

Q: What is the biggest challenge French authors face when trying to make a place for themselves in the global entertainment industry?

A: Most authors are unaware of what we consider the very first rule of the global entertainment industry. It does not buy or sell movie stars, screenwriters, or directors.

The business of the entertainment industry is the buying and selling of genres.

99.9% of all films, novels, TV series, video games, and webisodes belong to at least one genre and generally correspond to a combination of two, three, or even four genres.

Q: Why is this a specific problem for French authors?

A: For decades, French films have been trapped by the theory of auteur and art-house cinema, which could only lead to the idea that a film is built primarily on the director's point of view. This results in strange, self-centered dramas that interest no one other than the director's close circle. However, they do not result in good stories. And that's what the audience, not only French but also international, demands.

The key element that allows for storytelling with universal appeal is genre. But strangled by the theory of auteur and art-house cinema, most French screenwriters and writer-directors have despised genre storytelling, considered an American predictable matter addressing only the lowest common denominator. Refusing to make American films in French, they have worked on the margins of the genre so that their films have been neither good genre films nor good art-house films.

It has only been about fifteen years since the French entertainment industry realized it could not hope to compete in a global entertainment market driven not by the director's point of view but by the story, especially the genre story. Starting with thrillers and gangster stories, France has proven it can tell exciting, plot-driven genre stories that appeal to a wide audience worldwide while containing specifically French elements that distinguish them as artistic successes.

Q: What are the keys to mastering genre storytelling?

A: Genre is a specialized plot form, such as action, love, crime, or true story. In addition to being the basis of 99.9% of films, TV series, novels, and video games worldwide, genre has more impact than any other element on how you tell your story.

There are twelve major genres: action, comedy, suspense, crime, fantasy, horror, love, "masterpiece" (which, theoretically speaking, is not a true genre), memoirs/true story, myth, science fiction, and thriller. Each major genre has a unique set of narrative high points (events)—between eight and fifteen—that are used to chain the plot. Each genre also expresses a set of themes, a mini-philosophy about how to live well.

There are two main principles to follow to write a genre story that is not just a repetition of the story everyone tells in this form.

1. Mix genres that the audience is not used to seeing together.

"Inception," for example, combines science fiction and heist story.

2. Transcend the genre.

To transcend a genre, the author must use each of the specific high points of the form but reshape them to give them an aspect the audience has never seen before. The audience thus has the double pleasure of enjoying the narrative form they like and seeing it treated in a fresh and surprising way.

A PROPHET

Screenwriter-director Jacques Audiard is one of the first to have brought French cinema into genre storytelling, which now defines global entertainment. His technique? Transcend the form to benefit from the genre's popularity with a wide global audience, but also reshape this form to make it powerful and original.

As Jacques Audiard says, the stylization of the genre film is a way to accelerate the connection with the viewer. Here's the good guy, here's the bad guy. But once the viewer is on board, it's up to the filmmaker to be more subtle and push the boundaries of the genre.
A Prophet represents a significant advancement in French cinema, transitioning from difficult and slow films relying on the vision of their directors to fast-paced genre stories. With A Prophet, screenwriters Thomas Bidegain, Audiard, Abdel Raouf Dafri, and Nicolas Peufaillit found a way to transcend the false distinction between genre cinema and art-house cinema, thus creating a genre film that is, in itself, a true work of art.

Elaborate Plot and Genre Techniques in A Prophet

A Prophet is a transcendent gangster story that twists the rules of the highlights of this form and adds powerful dramatic elements that propel it to a higher level. Let's examine some of the techniques used in the script:

TECHNIQUE OF A PROPHET: TRAPPED IN A SYSTEM

The screenwriters use an advanced storytelling technique applied to the gangster story: the hero trapped in a system. The most advanced stories, in all mediums, place the individual within a vast society and pose this key question: how to live without being enslaved by a system?

In the opening scene, the hero of A Prophet, Malik, doesn't just enter prison; he enters a powerful and rigid system. From the first scenes, he gets a glimpse of this enslaving system and how it operates. Malik, in action and under the extreme threat of death, must reconstruct the hierarchy and rules of the system and determine how to play it before it kills him.

This technique is also used in another film that transcends the gangster narrative, The Godfather, although the character who enters the system here is not the hero. His function is to allow the screenwriters to begin exposing a complex system to the audience, but this explanation is emotional rather than intellectual, giving it a much stronger dramatic impact.

TECHNIQUE OF A PROPHET: THE DILEMMA

In the chapter on the seven steps, we explained that the screenwriters of A Prophet used the technique of postponing desire. The hero is unable to have an active goal in this harsh prison environment, and by postponing his desire, the authors allow the audience to experience the horror of the situation before being caught up in the action.

But with this technique, you risk losing some of your audience if you make them wait too long before starting the story. So the screenwriters immediately added another technique: the dilemma. To implement this technique, you must give the hero two contradictory goals: if he tries to win A, he will lose B, and if he tries to win B, he will lose A.

In the early scenes of A Prophet, the screenwriters move Malik from one dilemma to another, notably when the prison "boss" orders him to kill another inmate. Malik wants to survive, but he doesn't want to have another human's blood on his hands.

This technique reinforces the feeling of being trapped in the system for both the audience and the hero. It also has the advantage of providing the narrative dynamism of the story where the hero has no active goal.

TECHNIQUE OF A PROPHET: ADDING STORYLINES

At the beginning of A Prophet, Malik has no active desire and does not create the plot. But as he learns about the system and his power grows, he begins to aim for an active goal, which is to become the leader. And as the hero's goal strengthens, the screenwriters add other storylines, both inside and outside the prison.

Note that a reactive hero is not able to lead a plot. But by gaining knowledge and aiming for a goal, he gains the ability to create a plot, and the story becomes progressively more interesting. The hero and the audience follow the same path throughout the film, moving from one state to another:

1. Not understanding the system of enslavement and being a victim of it.

2. Understanding it, gradually controlling it, and ultimately, leading it.

Q: Can you give an example of another French film that transcends the genre?

A: Each major genre has a number of subgenres with their own sets of highlights (events) related to plot development.

"Traveling angel" stories deal with a perfect person who solves the problems of a community before moving on to another. It is an ancient form. It is found in the eternal stories of Santa Claus making his rounds, in classic detective stories like those of Sherlock Holmes, in classic westerns like Shane, and in some tragedies like Dead Poets Society.

But this story is more popular as a sub-form of comedy. Mary Poppins is the perfect example, as are Being There, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Crocodile Dundee, and Good Morning Vietnam.

TECHNIQUE: HOW TO TRANSCEND THE TRAVELING ANGEL COMEDY GENRE

It is mainly the traveling angel comedy, as well as the thriller and gangster film, that have paved the way for the French movement towards genre storytelling. One could even say that over the past fifteen years, France has become a true world leader in creating this type of story.

Amélie, Welcome to the Sticks, and The Intouchables are excellent examples of this highly popular form. The Chorus is a traveling angel drama linked to music. All these films reveal the potential of French cinema, which can be highly competitive in the global market while maintaining excellent quality and a distinctively French style.

THE INTOUCHABLES

(screenplay by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, 2011)

When you use a genre, you must find a way to make your story distinct from all those written in the same form. That is, to transcend the genre. To transcend the traveling angel comedy genre, the most important technique is to give the angel a moral weakness and need or, at the very least, a deep and genuine psychological weakness, which will be overcome by the end of the story. This way, the main character will not just be a perfect angel solving everyone else's problems; he will also have to overcome the weakness that ruins his life.

Most traveling angel comedies do not attribute a flaw to their angel, which tends to limit their emotional impact on the audience. If the French have become world leaders in this form of story, it is mainly because their main characters almost always have a deep flaw, as seen in Amélie or The Intouchables.

Let's now study the specific highlights of the traveling angel form and see how The Intouchables manages to both fit the genre and transcend it.

1. Start by establishing the community, not the hero.

2. Quickly but thoroughly expose the delicate situation in which the community and the people within it, who have particular weaknesses and problems, find themselves.

3. Introduce the traveling angel, perfect to some extent. The angel must always enter a unique arena.

The Intouchables twists the rules of this highlight by starting with the angel, not the community. And this is because the screenwriters gave him a moral flaw, a major structural element of a traveling angel story that transcends its genre. They needed to establish this weakness in the "angel" before presenting him actively solving the problems of the specific community mentioned.

Driss, the main character, returns to his aunt's house after spending six months in prison for theft. And he gives her a Fabergé egg he stole from Philippe when he applied for the job.

His aunt exclaims: "Do you think [...] I'm the biggest fool? Six months without seeing you, not a call, nothing. And you show up like a flower offering me a Kinder. Do you think it's with your schemes that I pay the rent? The groceries? [...] Idiot!" And she throws him out.

4. The angel must have a unique and amusing way of arriving.

Mary Poppins, for example, floats on a cloud.

Driss applies for the position of Philippe's caregiver, but he just wants a signature on a document to get his unemployment benefits. Philippe, in a wheelchair, asks him to come back the next day. Driss says goodbye with a "Stay seated."

5. The angel informs the characters that he will leave when he sees a sign.

This highlight is more common in traveling angel stories based on fantasy. It is therefore not used in The Intouchables.

6. Give the angel a good position in the community, but not one with too much responsibility.

Driss is Philippe's caregiver and home nurse.

7. Establish an opponent who is external to the community and an internal opponent who has responsibilities within the community. The internal opponent is often the father and the main adversary of the story. He is authoritarian and must learn to live.

In The Intouchables, Philippe is Driss's main adversary. He is a man of responsibilities, the "father" of the house. Traditionalist, sad, withdrawn, hopeless, he is simply trying to overcome his depressing life as a quadriplegic. He needs to learn not just to survive, but to live with joy, spirit, and love.

As the film focuses heavily on the love story between Driss and Philippe, it does not feature an external adversary.

In one of the best opposition scenes between the two protagonists, Philippe dictates a poetic letter to his pretty assistant, Magalie, addressed to Éléonore, a woman he has never met. Driss mocks Philippe's style: "Why go through all this mess? The sphinx, the daisies, the angels..." He turns to Magalie: "Are you interested in a guy who tells you that? [...] How long has it been going on? – Six months," replies Magalie. Driss insists that Philippe call Éléonore, before grabbing the last letter she wrote to him, which includes her phone number. "This means: call, I'll lick your ear," says Driss. He dials the number, and Philippe is forced to talk to her.

8. The angel must use cunning.

9. The angel has a series of realizations about the best ways to help the different people who have problems.

10. The angel solves the problems in this order: 1. those of the least important characters, 2. those of the external adversary, 3. those of the main (internal) adversary.

Driss confronts Philippe about the rudeness of Élisa, his spoiled daughter, towards all the household members. "She treats us all like dogs." Philippe agrees to talk to her.

Driss forces Élisa's boyfriend, Bastien, to apologize to her for breaking up and insulting her. And he orders Bastien to bring her croissants every day.

At Philippe's birthday, a classical orchestra plays music. Philippe tries to interest Driss in great music, but Driss responds that, for him, music is for dancing. Driss plays a funky Earth, Wind and Fire track and demonstrates a dance. "Come on, it's a birthday, let's dance!" he exclaims. The other people start dancing. Philippe laughs; he is clearly having a good time.

11. The realization occurs among the characters who have problems, especially the main (internal) adversary. They learn to have more self-esteem, to love, and to love life.

12. These realizations lead to marriages, and the community comes together to form a whole.

Driss takes Philippe to a luxurious seaside restaurant. He tells him: "I'm not staying for lunch, Philippe. In fact, you have a date." He returns the Fabergé egg he stole from him, asks him to kiss the young woman for him, and leaves. A pretty woman, Éléonore, sits across from Philippe and starts talking. Philippe seems delighted.

13. Once the angel has helped all the characters, especially the main internal adversary, solve their problems, he must see the sign and leave.

As Philippe talks with Éléonore, Driss walks away along the beach.

14. The community is saddened by the angel's departure, but its members have found love and know he will return one day.

The Weaving of Scenes

What makes Jane Austen and Charles Dickens such great authors, who still appeal to audiences in our world of ever-increasing technology and speed? The answer is simple: they are masters in the art of weaving scenes.

The word "scene" generally refers to a single action taking place in a single location at a given time. The scene is the basic unit of the story's progression, as experienced by the audience, here and now. The weaving of scenes is the organization of these units. Great authors create a tapestry-like weave, bringing a thread to the surface before plunging it below the weave to reappear later in the story.

The weaving of scenes, also known as the "scene list," "scene scheme," or "scene breakdown," is the final step before the full writing of the story or script. It is the list of all the scenes that you believe should be in the final story. This list also includes comments for each scene that corresponds to a structural step.

The weaving of scenes is an extremely important step in the writing process. Like the seven steps, the character network, and the sequence of twists-revelations, it is a way to see how the different elements of the story fit together beneath the surface.

The weaving of scenes is actually an extension of the plot. It is the plot, but more precise. The interest of the weaving of scenes is that it allows for a final look at the overall architecture of the story before writing it. Therefore, it should not be too detailed; this would tend to obscure the structure. Try to describe each scene in a single sentence. Here is an example of a description of four scenes from The Godfather:

• Michael saves the Don from an assassination attempt at the hospital.

• Michael accuses police captain McCluskey of working for Sollozzo. McCluskey hits him.

• Michael hints that he wants to eliminate the captain and Sollozzo.

• Clemenza explains to Michael how to kill them.

You will notice that only the essential action of each scene has been reported in the list. If you manage to describe each scene in one or two sentences, your list should only span a few pages. When a scene corresponds to a structural step (such as "desire," "plan," or "apparent defeat"), you should note it next to its description. Some scenes will have a comment, but many will not.

KEY POINT: Know that you will likely need to modify your scene weaving when you start writing the scenes one by one.

When writing a scene, you may discover that the essential action occurring in it is not what you thought. You can only be sure of this action by entering "into" the scene, that is, by writing it. Therefore, you must be very flexible. What is important at this stage of the process is to achieve an overall vision of the actions that you believe should be the main actions of the different scenes.

Know that the average American film has forty to seventy scenes. Novels generally have twice as many, or even much more (depending on their length and genre).

Your story may include subplots that, woven with the rest, will form the plot. If you have more than one subplot, assign each one a number. This will allow you to consider each subplot as a unit in itself and ensure that they build correctly.

Once your scene weaving is complete, determine if you need to make any of the following changes:

• Rearrange the order of the scenes Start by reflecting on the entire story. Then study the juxtapositions of each scene.

• Merge scenes Authors often create scenes solely because they think they can insert good lines into them. Whenever possible, merge scenes, ensuring that each scene corresponds to a single essential action.

• Cut or add scenes Always think about trimming. Remember that the pace of the story is not only related to the length of the scenes but also to the choice of scenes. Once you have removed the superfluous, you may feel that there are gaps between certain scenes that need to be filled with new ones. If so, add these new scenes to your list.

KEY POINT: The order of scenes should be dictated by structure, not chronology.

Most authors determine the order of scenes based on the chronological order of actions (scenes). This results in stories "padded" with unnecessary scenes. Instead, choose scenes by asking what they can contribute to the hero's development. If a scene contributes nothing to the hero's development, it is better to cut it.

With this technique, you ensure that each scene plays an essential role in the story and is in the right place. Most often, in the end, the scenes are in chronological order, but this is not necessarily the case.

KEY POINT: Pay special attention to the juxtaposition of scenes.

The juxtaposition of two scenes can be more important than the content of each scene, especially in television and cinema, where the transition from one scene to another is instantaneous. When studying juxtapositions, focus first on the contrast of content. Ask yourself how each scene comments on the scene that preceded it.

You can then look at the contrast of proportions and rhythms. Ask yourself if the length of each scene is appropriate to that of the scene that preceded it and well-proportioned in terms of importance.

The rule is simple: find the line and keep that line.

There are scenes—such as those of the subplot—that only serve to support the narrative line. Insert them and keep moving forward. But be aware that if you stray from the narrative line for too long, your story will eventually collapse.

There are many ways to give power to juxtapositions. The best of them, especially in cinema and television, is to juxtapose image and sound, that is, to separate these two means of communication to create a third meaning.

M

(Thea von Harbou and Fritz Lang, 1931)

A very good illustration of this technique is found in the great German film M: a child murderer buys a balloon for a little girl. In the next scene, a woman prepares dinner and calls her daughter, Elsie. As she continues to shout the little girl's name, the visual separates from the sound, and the audience sees an empty staircase, a group of buildings, Elsie's empty chair, and her plate and spoon on the kitchen table, all while hearing the increasingly desperate cries of the mother calling "Elsie!" The visual line ends with a shot showing a balloon caught in electrical wires before detaching and flying away. This contrast between the sound line and the visual line is the source of one of the most moving moments in cinema history.

The most common scene juxtaposition technique is undoubtedly cross-cutting. This technique allows for back-and-forth between two lines of action, or even more. Its consequences are twofold:

1. Cross-cutting creates suspense, especially when switching more and more quickly from one scene to another, for example, when a character must hurry to save another who is in danger.

2. It also allows for the comparison of two lines of action, two contents, and places them on an equal footing. This tends to broaden the scope of the theme. Each time you switch from one line of action to another, you move from a simple linear development (usually that of a single character) to the presentation of a deeper characteristic present throughout society.

An example of cross-cutting is found in the sequence of M where the story goes back and forth between a group of police officers and a group of criminals. Each group tries to determine how to catch the child murderer, and the cross-cutting shows the audience that these two types of people, generally considered opposites, are in many ways identical.

THE GODFATHER

(novel by Mario Puzo, screenplay by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, 1972)

An even better example of cross-cutting is found in the confrontation scene of The Godfather. The challenge was to create a confrontation scene that expressed Michael's character, who has become the new Godfather. By alternately showing Michael's men assassinating the heads of the five mafia families, the screenwriters not only managed to bring a series of punch events to the plot but also to express Michael's new position as a sort of crime business leader. Michael does not kill these men himself; these are not crimes of passion. He hires crime experts through his "company."
This first cross-cutting is complemented by a second: the story alternates between the multiple murders and Michael, who renounces Satan to become the godfather of a child whose father he will soon assassinate. Through this second cross-cutting, the audience understands that Michael has become Satan at the very moment he rises to the position of Godfather.

We would now like to compare the weaving of scenes from an early draft of The Godfather to the final version. This will allow you to see how much a good juxtaposition of scenes—and in this case, sections—can contribute to the quality of a story. The key difference between these two weavings of scenes appears right after Michael kills Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey in the restaurant. In the first draft, you will notice that the writers grouped all the scenes related to Sonny's death and the end of the war between the families (underlined). Then they grouped all the scenes of Michael in Sicily, ending with the assassination of his wife (in italics).

THE GODFATHER: FIRST DRAFT

1. In a restaurant, Michael talks with Sollozzo and McCluskey; Michael pulls out his gun and shoots them.

2. Montage of newspaper articles.

3. Sonny gets out of a woman's bed and goes to his sister Connie's.

4. Sonny notices that Connie has a black eye.

5. In the street, Sonny beats up Carlo, Connie's husband.

6. Tom refuses to give Michael Kay's letter.

7. Don Corleone returns home after his stay in the hospital.

8. Tom explains to Don Corleone what happened; the Don is sad.

9. Sonny and Tom argue because Tom wants to have old Tattaglia killed.

10. A violent argument breaks out between Connie and Carlo; Connie calls home; Sonny is furious.

11. Sonny is assassinated at the toll booth.

12. Tom informs Don Corleone of Sonny's death; Don Corleone responds that war must be declared.

13. Don Corleone and Tom bring Sonny's body to the undertaker Bonasera.

14. Don Corleone makes peace with the other family heads.

15. Don Corleone learns that the leader is actually Barzini.

16. In Sicily, Michael sees a pretty girl by the roadside and tells his father he would like to meet her.

17. Michael meets Apollonia.

18. Michael and Apollonia get married.

19. Wedding night.

20. Michael teaches Apollonia to drive; he is informed of Sonny's death.

21. Michael's car explodes while Apollonia is driving.

This sequence of scenes posed several problems. The most dramatic and important scenes from a plot perspective—those of Sonny's death and the revelation about Barzini—appeared first. There was thus a big lull when the plot moved to Sicily. Moreover, the sequence of Michael in Sicily was relatively long and slow. The story came to a screeching halt, and the writers had enormous difficulty getting the "train" moving again at the end of this section. By presenting all the scenes with Apollonia together, the writers also tended to emphasize the sudden and somewhat implausible aspect of Michael's marriage to a Sicilian peasant. The dialogues try to gloss over this aspect by suggesting that Michael fell in love at first sight. But if the audience had seen all these scenes at once, this explanation would have remained unconvincing.

THE GODFATHER: FINAL VERSION

In the final version of the script, the writers overcame the potentially fatal weakness of their scene weaving by alternating Sonny's line with Michael's:

1. In a restaurant, Michael talks with Sollozzo and McCluskey; Michael pulls out his gun and shoots them.

2. Montage of newspaper articles.

3. Don Corleone returns home after his stay in the hospital.

4. Tom explains to Don Corleone what happened; the Don is sad.

5. Sonny and Tom argue because Tom wants to have old Tattaglia killed.

6. In Sicily, Michael sees a pretty girl by the roadside and tells his father he would like to meet her.

7. Michael meets Apollonia.

8. Sonny gets out of a woman's bed and goes to his sister Connie's.

9. Sonny notices that Connie has a black eye.

10. In the street, Sonny beats up Carlo, Connie's husband.

11. Michael and Apollonia get married.

12. Wedding night.

13. Tom refuses to give Michael Kay's letter.

14. A violent argument breaks out between Connie and Carlo; Connie calls home; Sonny is furious.

15. Sonny is assassinated at the toll booth.

16. Tom informs Don Corleone of Sonny's death; Don Corleone responds that war must be declared.

17. Don Corleone and Tom bring Sonny's body to the undertaker Bonasera.

18. Michael teaches Apollonia to drive; he is informed of Sonny's death.

19. Michael's car explodes while Apollonia is driving.

20. Don Corleone makes peace with the other family heads.

21. Don Corleone learns that the leader is actually Barzini.

Due to the cross-cutting, on screen, the slow Sicilian line seems less long, preventing it from killing the narrative momentum of the plot. Moreover, the two lines converge to the same point, which is the apparent defeat of the hero, the lowest point he reaches during the story (see chapter 8, "The Plot"), the moment when he learns of Sonny's death just before witnessing his wife's. This "pair of slaps" is highlighted by the next big revelation: it was actually Barzini who was behind the whole story. This revelation about the true adversary's identity propels the rest of the plot toward its astonishing conclusion.

Of all the techniques we have presented in this book, scene weaving is probably the easiest to understand when illustrated with examples. So let's start with a simple example, taken from the TV series ER, because good series always rely on weaving a fine tapestry where multiple narrative lines are juxtaposed.

WEAVING MULTIPLE THREAD PLOT SCENES

The plot of series of this type includes between three and five threads, each with its own hero. Due to the limited time allotted to narrating each of the stories (each episode lasting sixty minutes minus commercials, or forty-five minutes), no plot line of any episode can have much depth. The writers hope to compensate for this problem over the entire season, or even over the succession of different seasons.

KEY POINT: With multiple-thread weaving, the quality of the entire story comes first from the juxtaposition of the plot lines. The problem faced by the members of a mini-society is compared at the same time. The audience is thus presented in condensed form with the different solutions the main characters bring to a problem that is generally the same for all.

KEY POINT: When there are three to five threads, you cannot go through the twenty-two steps for any of the plots. However, each plot must meet the seven major structural steps. If one of them has fewer than seven steps, it will not be a complete story, and the audience will find it useless and boring.

KEY POINT: When there are multiple main characters and multiple plots, you must frame the entire story and maintain the narrative line by making the hero of one line the adversary of the other. This prevents the story from exploding even more, and from ending up with, for example, five heroes, five adversaries, myriads of secondary characters, etc.

If ER and many other TV series use the alternation of threads, it is because this technique gives the episodes a strong dramatic density. These stories have no downtime. The audience only sees the dramatic "punch" scenes of each plot. ER's creator, Michael Crichton, who is also Hollywood's greatest premise author, managed to combine the advantages of medical drama and the "action" genre. Crichton added to this mix a network of characters covering a wide range of social classes, races, ethnic origins, nationalities, and genders. And this combination proved very powerful and very popular.

"THE HESITATION WALTZ" (Jack Orman, 2000)

The episode we will study has five plot lines, each built on a number of previous episodes.

• Plot no. 1 Abby visits her mother, Maggie. It is known that she is bipolar and tends to stop taking her medication, then disappear for long periods.

• Plot no. 2 Dr. Elizabeth Corday is being sued: she allegedly botched one of her operations, causing her patient to be paralyzed.

• Plot no. 3 In a previous episode, Dr. Peter Benton's nephew was murdered by street gang members. The boy's girlfriend, Kynesha, shows up at the hospital, her face marked by blows.

• Plot no. 4 Dr. Mark Greene has hidden something from his girlfriend Elizabeth (Dr. Corday) and the other doctors. Today he will find out if his brain tumor is fatal.

• Plot no. 5 Due to his previous drug problems, Dr. Carter must undergo regular medical exams if he wishes to continue working at the hospital.

The first thing you notice in this episode is that the different plot lines have an underlying unity. They are variations on the same problem. And that's what makes the juxtaposition interesting. On a superficial level, most of these plots involve a character with drug problems. But, more importantly, the five plots talk about the consequences of lying and sincerity.

The strength of the weaving of "The Hesitation Waltz" relies on two principles of storytelling: each plot is a variation on the theme of truth and lies, and the five stories converge toward the most powerful realizations or twist-revelations that the main character and the plot are capable of receiving.

Enigma

1. Abby's mother, Maggie, who is bipolar, finds her daughter counting her medication. Abby wants to have her mother take a blood test to ensure she is taking her medication. Plot no. 1: weakness and need, adversary.

By studying this scene weaving in detail, you will notice that each plot line meets the seven steps. Each story is thus strong enough to stand on its own. Once these foundations are established, the writer can play with the juxtaposition of individual scenes from each plot.

Act 1

2. Dr. Greene reassures his girlfriend, Elizabeth, by telling her she did not commit negligence and that her deposition will be perfect. Elizabeth tells him to stop bumping his head against signposts when jogging. Plot no. 2: weakness and need; plot no. 4: problem and need.

3. At the hospital, Maggie begs Abby not to have her take a blood test, saying that both of them would feel worse. Abby reluctantly agrees. Plot no. 1: desire, adversary.

4. A woman named Stephanie is looking for Dr. Malucci. Maggie arrives running and says a young girl has been thrown from a car. Plot no. 3: weakness and need.

5. Dr. Cleo Finch, Abby, and Maggie help the injured girl. Abby asks her mother to leave. Plot no. 3: weakness and need.

6. Lawyer Bruce Resnick, the opposing counsel, is strangely friendly with Elizabeth when he meets her for her deposition. Plot no. 2: adversary.

7. Cleo tells Dr. Peter Benton that he should not take the patient because she is his late nephew's girlfriend. Dr. Benton refuses to listen. Plot no. 3: specter, desire.

8. Greene learns from his doctor that his tumor is inoperable. Plot no. 4: twist-revelation.

Act 2

9. Carter corrects a misdiagnosis by Greene. Greene reminds Carter that he must take his blood and urine tests due to his drug problem. Plot no. 5: weakness and need, adversary; plot no. 4: desire.

10. Peter, Cleo, and Abby try to determine if Kynesha was raped. She insists she just fought with a group of girls. Plot no. 3: adversary.

11. In her deposition, Elizabeth states that she had to operate on her former lover Peter's (Dr. Benton) nephew first and was upset by the boy's death when she operated on the opposing party's client. Plot no. 2: momentum, adversary.

12. Carter jokes while Abby draws his blood. Greene doesn't seem amused at all. Abby learns her mother had an incident in a clothing store. Plot no. 5: adversary. Plot no. 1: twist-revelation.

13. Kynesha refuses to reveal to Peter the identity of her attackers. Peter tells her that if his nephew was killed, it was because he came to see her. She explains that if the gang members killed him, it was actually because he was trying to get her out of the gang. Plot no. 3: twist-revelation.

14. Abby must help her mother to avoid a shoplifting charge. Plot no. 1: adversary

15. Greene reproaches Carter for not taking his medication, as stipulated in his contract. Carter responds that it's too much. Greene collapses and has a seizure. Plots no. 4 and 5: combine personal stories via opposition between doctors.

In scene 10 (plot no. 3), Kynesha arrives at the hospital. She has been beaten and possibly raped. Kynesha is the girlfriend of Peter's nephew, who died some time ago. In the next scene (11, plot no. 2), the lawyer asks Dr. Corday if she was affected by the young man's death when she operated on his client. Scene 10 (plot no. 3) is therefore an extension of the plot line to which scene 11 (plot no. 2) refers.

Act 3

16. Greene gets up and refuses to comply with Carter's request, who advises him to get a head scan. Plot no. 4: narrative momentum.

17. Lawyer Resnick states that Elizabeth operated on his client too quickly because she was in a hurry to get to a personal appointment. Plot no. 2: adversary.

Scenes 16 (plot no. 4), 17 (plot no. 2), and 18 (plot no. 1) all feature characters—Greene, Elizabeth, and Maggie—who lie to others and refuse to admit the importance of their problem.

18. Maggie insists she acted within her rights. Abby tells her mother she needs stitches. Plot no. 1: adversary.

19. Police officers ask Kynesha to reveal the identity of Peter's killer so they can arrest him. Kynesha refuses to speak. Plot no. 3: adversary.

20. Greene explains to Carter that he has a brain tumor and will probably no longer be able to work from today. Plot no. 5: twist-revelation.

21. Elizabeth's lawyer asks her to limit her answers to yes and no. Elizabeth responds that this amounts to hiding the truth. Plot no. 2: adversary.

In scene 20 (plot no. 5), Greene finally tells someone the truth about himself. This scene is immediately followed by scene 21 (plot no. 2) in which his girlfriend Elizabeth's lawyer asks her to hide the truth.

22. Maggie flirts with Abby's boyfriend, Dr. Kovac, while he stitches her wound. She is under the influence of drugs. Abby apologizes. Her mother verbally attacks her and then runs away. Kovac brings her back to the operating table while she screams at Abby not to do this to her. Plot no. 1: adversary.

The last scene, the dramatic convergence point of act 3, presents the terrible consequences of lying. At her workplace, Abby, belittled by her mother, experiences intense public humiliation.

Act 4

23. Elizabeth gets up to make the last part of her deposition and comes face to face with her patient waiting in a wheelchair. Her lawyer tells her not to be moved. Plot no. 2: twist-revelation, narrative momentum.

24. The hospital psychologist tells Abby she can admit her mother to her service if she wishes, but Abby doesn't care about her words. She leaves. Plot no. 2: narrative momentum.

In scene 23 (plot no. 2), which corresponds to the beginning of the final act, Elizabeth is confronted with the consequences of her negligence: the patient who sued her shows up at the deposition in a wheelchair.

25. Peter puts Kynesha in a taxi, giving her recommendations on how to care for her injuries. Kynesha gives him the finger. Plot no. 3: adversary.

26. The opposing party's lawyer claims the anesthetist told Elizabeth that some cerebrospinal fluid could leak. She lies by maintaining that she conducted a thorough examination. Plot no. 2: confrontation, revelation for the audience.

27. Carter tells Abby that her mother is no longer there. Abby replies that she often disappears for four months before reappearing; "It comes and goes, it's our little waltz." Plots no. 5 and no. 1: combine personal stories by having one addict learn about another; Plot no. 1: realization.

28. Kynesha tells Peter that police officers came to her house and that gang members will now want to kill her. Peter puts her in his car. Plot no. 3: adversary.

As the story nears its end, confrontations and twists multiply, which is one of the greatest narrative advantages of the multiple-thread technique. In the confrontation scene of plot no. 2 (scene 26), during her deposition, Elizabeth makes her big moral decision: she lies. Then Abby, from plot no. 1, explains to Carter, who lied about his own drug problems in plot no. 5, that her mother and she are in a constant waltz of drugs, lies, and mutual meanness.

29. Elizabeth explains to Greene that the deposition went badly. She tells him she lied. Greene replies that she is not the only one. He explains that his headaches are not from a jogging accident. Plot no. 2: twist-revelation and realization.

In the penultimate scene of the episode, Greene and Elizabeth support each other to face a negative reality.

30. Abby gets out of the bed she shares with Kovac, turns on the bathroom sink faucet, and starts crying. Plot no. 1: former balance.

The last scene constitutes a brilliant dramatic twist for the first plot. By starting and ending with a scene from plot no. 1, the writer framed the entire episode and unified all the story's plot lines. Abby wakes up in the middle of the night and turns on the bathroom faucet to cry without waking her partner. For people who constantly dance the same waltz, things never change. We return to the former balance. For Abby, the realization about her mother and herself was tragic. The audience suddenly realizes that life is not a story where people necessarily change and flourish at the end. And this is painful. It's a very beautiful weaving of scenes.

WEAVING SCENES – WRITING EXERCISE NO. 8

• Scene List Make a list of all the scenes in your story. Try to describe each scene in one sentence.

• Twenty-two Steps Comment on all the scenes that correspond to one of the twenty-two steps. If your story has multiple plot lines, mark after each scene the number of the plot it corresponds to.

• Scene Order Study the order of the scenes. Ensure that the sequence of scenes is well constructed on structure, not chronology.

1. Cut unnecessary scenes.

2. Merge all the scenes you can.

3. Add scenes if you notice gaps in the story's development.

The best way to understand scene weaving is through practice, so we would like to change our usual end-of-chapter pattern by studying not one but several examples. Of course, each scene weaving is unique to its story. But precisely, by observing each of the examples, think about the different scene weaving problems that must be solved by the author depending on the story's particularity and its genre.

WEAVING SCENES OF THE DETECTIVE STORY

L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (novel by James Ellroy, screenplay by Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson, 1997)

L.A. Confidential presents one of the best scene weavings we have seen in recent years. It's a huge funnel that begins with three police heroes in the corrupt world of the Los Angeles Police Department. As the story progresses, the writers weave these three distinct threads together so that they form a single narrative line. The narrative momentum relies on the three heroes, who function among themselves as adversaries while searching for the killer, the funnel's convergence point.

These foundations allow the writers to compare, through cross-cutting, the three heroes and their different approaches to justice and crime-solving. They also allow them to create a series of twists that become increasingly dense as the funnel narrows and the story moves toward its convergence point.

In the following scene weaving, Bud White is designated as hero no. 1, Jack Vincennes as hero no. 2, Ed Exley as hero no. 3, and Captain Smith as the main adversary, although he appears to be an ally.

1. In voice-over, Sid Hudgens, editor-in-chief of the scandal magazine Hush-Hush, presents Los Angeles as a paradise but claims it's just an image. Beneath the surface, Mickey Cohen runs organized crime. Story universe.

In the opening scene, a voice-over narrator establishes the foundations of the story universe—the Los Angeles of the 1950s—and the essential thematic opposition on which this world rests—an apparent utopia that is corrupt beneath its surface.

2. Officer Bud White arrests a parolee who has just beaten his wife. Hero no. 1.

3. Sid agrees to pay Sergeant Jack Vincennes, technical advisor to the TV series Badge of Courage, to arrest an actor in possession of cannabis so he can photograph him. Hero no. 2: need, false ally.
4. Sergeant Ed Exley answers questions from a journalist who asks what it's like to start in the police force. Captain Dudley Smith implies that Ed doesn't have the guts to become a detective because he refuses to break the law to catch criminals. Ed insists he wants to become a detective lieutenant. Hero no. 3: desire, main adversary, false ally.

5. Bud is buying alcohol for the precinct's year-end party when he meets Lynn Bracken, a young woman with the looks of Veronica Lake. Hero no. 1: desire.

6. Outside, Bud beats up Leland Meeks, a former cop turned driver for Pierce Patchett. A bandaged woman resembling Rita Hayworth tells him she's fine. Bud's partner, Dick Stensland, says he's seen Meeks before but doesn't know him personally. Hero no. 1: adversary, story universe, ally.

7. Jack arrests actor Matt Reynolds and a girl, while Sid photographs the scene for Hush-Hush magazine.

8. While searching for cannabis in Matt's apartment, Jack discovers a card marked "Fleur de Lis." Sid writes his article and pays Jack. Hero no. 2: twist-revelation.

9. Stensland explains to other officers that if they're late, it's because Bud had to help a damsel in distress.

10. When Jack arrives with Matt and the girl, he gives Ed $10 for allowing the operation to proceed smoothly. Ed refuses. Hero no. 2 vs. hero no. 3: adversary.

11. Cops enter the precinct with Mexicans who had beaten other officers earlier in the evening. Drunk, the cops, led by Stensland, beat the Mexicans despite Ed's protests. Bud and Jack join them. Hero no. 1 and no. 2: adversary.

12. Bud refuses to testify about his colleagues' role in the fight. He is suspended from duty.

These early scenes lead to a turning point defining the three heroes and the corrupt world of the police. Ed is the only cop who refuses to beat the Mexicans (scene 11). In this scene and the following ones, Ed becomes an adversary to Bud and Jack (scenes 10-15).

13. Ed agrees to testify and suggests the chief corner Stensland and Bud. The chief promotes Ed to lieutenant. Ed explains how to get Jack to confirm his testimony. Hero no. 3: narrative drive, story world.

14. The chief threatens Jack with banning him from working on the series. Jack eventually agrees to testify.

15. Before testifying, Jack asks Ed what he got in exchange for his own testimony. He strongly advises him always to support his colleagues, especially Bud. Hero no. 2 and no. 3: adversary.

16. The captain returns Bud's badge and gun and asks him to join him for a special mission, a "muscle job" related to a homicide. Hero no. 1: desire.

17. Two of Cohen's henchmen are murdered in their car. Adversary's plan.

18. Cohen's dealer is shot in his house. Adversary's plan.

19. In an isolated hotel, the Victory Motel, Bud beats up a gangster, whom the captain tells it's time to leave town. Hero no. 1: narrative drive.

From scene 16 to scene 21, the story fragments into three lines presented in alternating montage. Bud has a new role as the captain's henchman; the hidden adversary kills several gangsters; and Jack discovers a clue that will ultimately lead to one of the two main adversaries.

20. While working on his new mission, Jack notices the fleur-de-lis sign on pornographic photographs circulating in the city. Hero no. 2: twist-revelation.

21. Jack tries in vain to find information about an organization called "Fleur de Lis." Sid claims he's never heard of it. Hero no. 2: narrative drive.

22. Stensland returns his gun and badge, says goodbye to his colleagues, and, as he leaves, kicks a box that lands at Ed's feet.

23. Stensland tells Bud he has a confidential date tonight but that they'll have a drink together during the week. Hero no. 3: adversary.

24. Alone in the precinct, Ed learns by phone that several murders have occurred in a bar, the Nite Owl. Hero no. 3: inciting event.

25. Ed goes to the crime scene and discovers a pile of bodies in the bathroom. Hero no. 3: desire.

26. The captain decides to take charge of the investigation and makes Ed his second. They discover that one of the victims is none other than Stensland. Hero no. 3: twist-revelation.

27. Bud goes to see Stensland's body in the morgue. Ed explains what seems to have happened.

28. A woman struggles to identify her daughter's body. She says she's changed a lot. Bud realizes the dead girl is Susan Lefferts, the girl who looked like Rita Hayworth in the car. Hero no. 1: twist-revelation.

29. The captain tells his men that three young black men were seen shooting and driving a brown car in the neighborhood the night of the murder. The chief tells the officers not to spare any means. False ally's plan; hero no. 1, 2, and 3: narrative drive.

30. Bud decides to investigate something else. Ed agrees to help Jack verify a hunch. Hero no. 1, 2, and 3: narrative drive.

31. Bud asks the liquor store owner for Susan's address. Hero no. 1: narrative drive.

32. Patchett tells Bud that if the girl's face in the morgue was marked, it's because she just had cosmetic surgery to look like Rita Hayworth. Susan was part of his stable of movie star lookalikes who rented out their services. Hero no. 1: twist-revelation.

33. Bud asks one of Lynn's clients, a city councilman, to leave. Lynn explains the deal she made with Patchett. Bud asks to see her again, then retracts his words. Hero no. 1: desire.

34. A black boxer, whose brother is in prison, explains to Jack and Ed where they can find a man driving a brown car. Hero no. 2 and 3: twist-revelation.

35. When Jack and Ed arrive, two detectives are already in front of the brown car. During the arrest, Ed asks the two other cops not to shoot the three black men.

36. The captain tells Ed that the cartridges found in the back of the brown car are identical to those from the crime scene. During the interrogation, Ed uses a sound recording system to let each of the three suspects hear the statements made by the others, making them talk. Hero no. 3: twist-revelation.

37. Ed manages to get one of the men to admit he hurt a girl, and Bud threatens to kill him if he doesn't give him the address. Hero no. 1 and 3: twist-revelation.

38. Bud enters the house first and discovers a girl lying on a bed. He shoots a black man in the chest, then puts a gun in his hands to make it look like he fired first. Hero no. 1: narrative drive.

39. Ed tells Bud he doesn't think the naked man was armed. Bud replies that he tried to hit him. The two cops learn that the Nite Owl suspects have escaped. Hero no. 1 vs. hero no. 3: opposition.

40. Ed looks at the interrogation transcript to find out where the suspects got their drugs. He asks one of the captain's men to help him. Hero no. 3: twist-revelation.

41. A shootout erupts. Ed is the only survivor. Hero no. 3: narrative drive.

42. The captain and other cops congratulate Ed and start calling him "Shotgun Ed."

In this section of the script, the writers avoid fragmenting the narrative line by focusing on the opposition between the heroes, Bud and Ed (scene 39). Ed searches for the escaped suspects. He is the only survivor of the shootout (scenes 40 and 41). This large section of the story ends with what seems to be the end of the narrative drive (scenes 42-44).

43. Ed is awarded a medal of honor.

44. Jack receives a warm welcome upon his return to the series set.

45. Lynn notices Bud watching her from his car.

46. The city councilman tells a man he won't vote for Patchett's project. The man shows the councilman a photo of him in bed with Lynn. Adversary's plan.

47. The city councilman announces he will vote for the project.

The writers then bring the adversary, Patchett, from the background to the forefront through several scenes revealing the extent of his influence over the city (scenes 46-49).

48. Patchett attends the Santa Monica freeway inauguration.

49. Patchett smiles as he watches Lynn flirt with a client at one of his receptions.

50. Bud is disgusted when the captain asks him to beat up another gangster at the Victory Motel. The captain watches him drive away.

51. Bud knocks on Lynn's door, and she lets him in. They kiss on the bed. Hero no. 1: narrative drive (second).

52. Sid pays Jack $50 to arrest the prosecutor in the act with young actor Matt Reynolds later in the evening. Matt asks Jack if they've met at a "Fleur de Lis" party. Sid and Jack promise Matt a role in the series if he agrees to have an affair with the prosecutor. Hero no. 2: narrative drive.

53. Bud and Lynn go to the movies.

54. Jack feels guilty and leaves the $50 bill Sid gave him on the bar. Hero no. 2: realization, moral decision.

55. Jack goes to the motel and discovers Matt is already dead. Hero no. 2: twist-revelation.

56. The rape victim tells Ed she lied about the actions of the three men. Hero no. 3: twist-revelation.

57. In bed, Lynn tells Bud she plans to return to her hometown in two years to open a clothing store. He tells her he got his scar trying to save his mother, whom his father beat to death. Bud wants to stop being the captain's muscle and work on homicide cases. He feels something is wrong with the Nite Owl case.

Lynn tells him he's insightful. Hero no. 1: ghost, desire (new).

58. Bud looks at the Nite Owl photos. He remembers that Stensland and Susan died there. Hero no. 1: twist-revelation.

59. Susan's mother identifies Stensland as her daughter's boyfriend. Bud finds something fishy and discovers Meeks' body under the house. Hero no. 1: twist-revelation.

60. Ed is concerned about the Nite Owl case and discovers Bud was also interested in it this morning. Hero no. 3: twist-revelation.

61. Ed learns from Susan's mother that Bud has already searched under the house. Hero no. 3: twist-revelation.

From this point, the story tightens around the heroes' search for the real killer. Initially, each investigates on their own, with their own reasons (linked to redemption) and using their own techniques (scenes 58-62).

62. Ed takes the body to the morgue and tells the staff not to talk about it.

63. Ed asks Jack to follow Bud because he doesn't trust any cop. He explains that he nicknamed the man who killed his father, a policeman, and got away with it "Rollo Tomasi." That's why he wanted to become a cop. Jack replies he doesn't remember why he wanted to become a cop. He agrees to help Ed with the Nite Owl case if Ed agrees to help him solve Matt's murder. Hero no. 2 and 3: ghost, desire, realization, moral decision.

64. Gangster Johnny Stompanato tells Bud that Meeks probably tried to run off with a load of cocaine he was entrusted with. Hero no. 1: twist-revelation.

65. Jack and Ed see Bud kissing Lynn in her apartment. Hero no. 2 and 3: twist-revelation.

66. Jack tells Ed he thinks all these cases are linked to "Fleur de Lis."

67. Ed tries to question Stompanato. He mistakes the real Lana Turner for a lookalike prostitute. Hero no. 2 and 3: twist-revelation.

68. Jack and Ed question Patchett about Matt and ask why Bud is having an affair with Lynn. But Patchett says nothing.

69. After Ed and Jack leave, Patchett calls Sid. Adversary's plan.

70. The coroner tells Jack the body is indeed Meeks'. Hero no. 2: twist-revelation.

71. Jack asks to see Meeks' file when he worked in vice.

72. Lynn tells Ed that if she loves Bud, it's because he's the opposite of him, Ed, the political animal who would ruin himself to solve a case. Ed starts kissing her. She moves so Sid can take good photos of them in bed. Hero no. 3: desire.

73. Jack goes to the captain's house. He remembers that a few years ago, the captain supervised a case where Stensland and Meeks investigated Patchett. The captain shoots Jack. Jack's last words are "Rollo Tomasi." Attack of the false ally; hero no. 2: twist-revelation.

74. The captain tells his team to relentlessly pursue Jack's killer. He questions Ed about a possible associate of Jack, Rollo Tomasi. False ally's plan; hero no. 3: twist-revelation.

75. The captain asks Bud to accompany him to the Victory Motel to help beat up the man who likely killed Jack.

76. The coroner explains to Ed that he told Jack the body was indeed Meeks', the former cop. Hero no. 3: twist-revelation.

As they took particular care in creating the story universe's foundations and crafted three seemingly distinct narrative lines at the beginning, the writers can now hit the audience with a series of twists. Ed and Jack's teamwork ends with the most surprising twist, which has a bombshell effect on the audience: the captain kills Jack (scene 73).

77. The captain interrogates Sid about Jack and Patchett while Bud beats him up. When Sid claims he photographed Lynn sleeping with a cop, Bud goes into a rage, tears the photos from him, and leaves. Attack of the false ally; hero no. 1: twist-revelation.

78. The captain finishes off Sid while he begs, saying they form a team with Patchett. Revelation for the audience.

79. Ed asks an employee to find the file listing people Meeks arrested when he worked in vice.

80. Lynn tells Bud she thought she was helping him by sleeping with Ed. Bud hits her. Hero no. 1: adversary.

81. Ed learns that Meeks and Stensland were under the captain's orders. Bud hits Ed. Ed points a gun at Bud, saying Meeks was killed over a heroin deal. Ed tells him Dudley's men must have framed the three black men, and somehow all these cases are linked to Patchett.

Bud and Ed continue searching separately until a mini-confrontation. Then they agree to work together (scene 81). This team will lead the rest of the story.

Hero no. 3: twist-revelation. Hero no. 1 vs. hero no. 3: opposition.

82. Ed tells the prosecutor he wants an investigation into the captain and Patchett. The prosecutor refuses. In the bathroom, Bud shaves his head and hangs him out the window. The prosecutor then admits the captain and Patchett take a cut from Cohen's rackets, but he can't prosecute them because they have compromising photos of him. Adversary; hero no. 1 and 3: twist-revelation.

83. Ed and Bud find Patchett dead next to a fake suicide letter. Hero no. 1 and 3: twist-revelation.

84. Ed asks the local police to escort Lynn to the station to protect her from the captain.

85. Lynn tells Ed she knows nothing about the captain.

86. Bud finds Sid dead in his office. He learns Ed has arranged to meet him at the Victory Motel. Hero no. 1: twist-revelation.

87. When Bud arrives, he realizes he and Ed have fallen into a trap. A shootout ensues, and Bud and Ed kill several of the captain's men. Bud falls into a hole in the floor. Ed is hit. Two men arrive to finish him off when Bud emerges from the floor and kills them. The captain shoots Bud twice. Ed calls the captain "Rollo Tomasi, the guy who gets away with it." Bud stabs the captain's leg. The captain shoots Bud again, but Ed points a shotgun at him. The captain promises Ed he'll make him chief detective if he doesn't kill him. Sirens are heard approaching. Ed shoots the captain in the back. Hero no. 1 and 3: twist-revelation, final confrontation; hero no. 3: realization, moral decision.

88. During the interrogation, Ed explains that the captain was behind the murders of Susan, Patchett, Sid, and Jack and that he worked with the Los Angeles mob. The prosecutor tells the police chief they might save the precinct's reputation by turning the captain into a hero. Ed says it would take more than one hero for that to work. Story universe.

89. The chief awards Ed a new medal. From afar, Lynn watches.

90. Ed thanks Bud, covered in bandages in the back seat of Lynn's car, who is leaving for her hometown. New balance, hero no. 1 and 3.

Ever the politician, Ed earns another medal from this murder (scene 89). He says goodbye to his radical opposite, Bud, the simple guy who goes to live in a small town with Lynn (scene 90).

60. At the airport, the opening voice-over is repeated, but this time it's Alex's heart that's broken. Mélanie advises him to return to his life of lies and brief affairs. Their father was right: he runs away when things get tough. He defends himself and leaves.

64. Sophie tells Jonathan she doesn't understand how Juliette could do this to him. She tells him she's available.

65. Juliette's father tells the thugs that Alex must not know that he actually owed the money to himself.

girl he was in love with when he was young. Later, he will say: "I told you the greatest humiliation of my life. But you, you told me nothing."

She will then explain her specter, which is not related to romantic relationships: when she was in college, she followed a rock star's tour and missed her mother's funeral.

There is a true sense of initiation between the two main characters as they share their most painful memories, and despite the scam (of which only Alex, its author, is aware), a genuine intimacy develops between them.

As the film approaches its end, Alex takes the scam to an even higher level: he wants to "work without a net." He decides to focus on Juliette's psychological need. An action film highlight is also introduced here: the hero is at his best when improvising.

66. Marc tries to take over Alex's job by seducing women. He fails and asks Mélanie to critique his work.

Scene 44:

Highlight 12: The confrontation must take place in a public place where everyone is disoriented and everyone mistakes each other's identities.

This is not the case here. The scam continues until the end of the story, and the two main characters do not have a final confrontation scene in front of a group of witnesses. The screenwriters have therefore reversed this highlight. In scene 44, the "confrontation" is actually the couple's first date and first dance, which mimics the loved one's favorite movie, Dirty Dancing.

By the first dance of a love story, we mean the moment when future lovers dance, either physically or verbally, and where the intimacy between them reaches a new level. It's love expressed through action.

In a romantic comedy, the first dance usually occurs at the beginning of the middle section. It's often the best scene in the love story. But when it happens so early, its power is sometimes diminished.

The first dance is the best highlight in Heartbreaker, and thanks to the film's unique structure that pushes it to the end of the story, this highlight has an exceptional dramatic and emotional impact. You will also notice that the hero is still in the logic of the scam, which thus reaches new heights.

Key point: Delaying the first dance and the first kiss until the climax of the story is a brilliant maneuver, which also reveals the power that can be obtained by twisting the rules of genre highlights and transcending the form.

Scene 60:

Highlight 13: During the psychological realization, each understands that they are in love with the other and that they are not chained by their past. At the airport, Alex repeats the opening sequence in voice-over, but this time it's his heart that's broken. His sister tells him: "It's true what Dad said: as soon as it gets difficult, you run away."

This is Alex's psychological realization. Confronted by his sister, who throws his initial weakness in his face, he responds: "I'm not running away!" And he runs to try to win the heart of the love of his life before she marries another.

It is in scene 62 that Juliette has her realization. As she walks up the aisle with her father, her "perfect" fiancé waiting just a few meters away, she has a stunning realization when her father whispers to her that Alex refused the money he was supposed to give him.

Her realization? I'm in love with Alex and he sacrificed himself for me. So she runs away to be with the man she truly loves. This highlight echoes the end of a classic American romantic comedy, It Happened One Night.

Scene 63:

Highlight 14: In the moral realization, the hero and the loved one must both understand that they have been selfish and undertake a moral action. This is the "double-reversal" during which each learns from the other and evolves.

Ideally, each of the two main characters should sacrifice for the other the strongest symbol of their selfishness.

During his moral realization, Alex gives up Juliette's father's money and confesses the truth to Juliette: he hates everything she loves. He doesn't know if he's good enough for her – he doesn't own a private jet or an apartment and sleeps in his office – but he needs to see her every day. This line echoes the end of When Harry Met Sally.

Juliette's moral realization? She apparently gives up her fortune and forgives him for his scam by kissing him.

This moment represents a minor weakness in the script: she has no trouble forgiving him for lying to her and almost ruining what she thought was her marriage to the ideal man.

Scene 63:

Highlight 15: The story ends with a wedding.

In Heartbreaker, the two characters run toward each other and form a union, a sort of marriage, with their first kiss.

Key point: The first kiss of the two main characters occurs in the last scene. As they did for the first dance highlight, the authors delayed this kiss to place it literally at the end of the film. This first kiss, which is already a major event, thus produces an even stronger emotional impact.

Construction of scenes and symphonic dialogues

Scenes are the framework of action. Through description and dialogue, all elements of the premise, structure, characters, moral debate, story universe, symbols, plot, and scene weaving are transformed into a story that will be experienced by the audience. It is with the construction of scenes that the story is brought to life.

The word "scene" refers to a single action taking place in a single location at a given time. But what are scenes composed of? How do they work?

A scene is a mini-story. This means that a good scene must go through six of the seven structural steps, the exception being the realization, which is reserved for the end of the story. In most scenes, the realization step is generally replaced by something else: a twist, a surprise, or a discovery.

BUILDING A SCENE

When you build a scene, you must always set two goals:

• Determine its place in the overall development of the story and the function it fulfills.

• Make it a mini-story.

These two goals must necessarily be achieved, with the arc of the hero's overall development remaining a priority.

KEY POINT: Think of the scene as a triangle pointing downward.

The beginning of the scene should summarize its entire content, then the scene should converge to a precise point, with the most important word or phrase being spoken last:

Now let's study the steps you should ideally go through to build a scene. Ask yourself the following questions:

1. Position in the character arc: What place does this scene occupy in the character's development (also known as the character arc) and what function does it fulfill?

2. Problems: What problems need to be resolved in this scene, or what goals need to be accomplished?

3. Strategy: What strategy can be used to solve these problems?

4. Desire: Which character's desire will lead this scene (it can be the hero or another character)? What do they desire? This desire will provide the scene with its backbone.

5. Outcome: What is the outcome of this character's desire? By determining the end in advance, you will build the entire scene with confidence that you are heading toward this point.

The outcome of the desire also coincides with the tip of the inverted triangle, the moment when the most important word or phrase in the scene appears. This combination of desire fulfillment and key word or phrase produces a K.O. that also pushes the audience toward the next scene.

6. Opponent: Determine who opposes the hero's desire and why the characters are fighting.

7. Plan: The character with the desire has a plan that should allow them to achieve their goal. Within a scene, characters can use two types of plans: the direct plan or the indirect plan.

With a direct plan, the character with a goal openly and directly defines what they wish to achieve. With an indirect plan, they pretend to want one thing while actually wanting something else. The opponent has one of two reactions: they understand the deception and manipulate the hero, or they are fooled and end up giving the character exactly what they wanted to obtain.

There is a simple rule to determine which kind of plan the character should use: the direct plan increases the intensity of the conflict and separates the characters. The indirect plan, at first, decreases the intensity of the conflict and brings the characters together, but it can later also increase the conflict when the deception is revealed.

Note that the term "plan" here refers to how the character attempts to achieve their goal in the scene, not in the entire story.

8. Conflict: Build the conflict gradually until its outcome: the rupture or the appeasement.

9. Twist or revelation: From time to time, the characters or the audience (or both) are surprised by what happens before their eyes. Or a character reveals something to another in an aside. This is a kind of realization on the scale of the scene, but it is not definitive and may even prove to be wrong.

You will notice that many writers, thinking they are making their story more "realistic," start their scenes very early and develop them slowly until the main conflict. This does not make the scenes more realistic; it makes them boring.

KEY POINT: Start your scenes as late as possible, but without skipping any of the key structural steps you need.

COMPLEX SCENES OR SUBTEXT SCENES

A subtext scene is generally defined as a scene in which the characters do not say what they really want. This definition may be true, but it does not tell you how to write this type of scene.

The first thing to understand about subtext is that popular wisdom is wrong: subtext is not always the best way to write a scene. In general, subtext characters do not say what they think or really want because they are afraid, because it would be painful, or because they are simply embarrassed. If you want a scene with maximum conflict, do not use subtext. But of course, if subtext is a technique suited to your characters and their scenes, you should absolutely not hesitate to use it.

The subtext scene relies on two structural elements: desire and plan. To achieve maximum subtext, the following techniques can be used:

• Assign several characters in the scene a secret desire. The different desires must conflict with each other. For example, A is secretly in love with B, who is secretly in love with C.

• Ensure that all characters with a secret desire use an indirect plan to achieve their ends. These characters say something, but they actually want something else. They may try to deceive others, but they may also use a ruse that they themselves find crude while hoping that the artifice will have enough charm to allow them to obtain what they want.

DIALOGUES

Once your scenes are constructed, you must use description and dialogue to write them. The delicate art of description goes beyond the scope of a work on fiction. This is not the case with dialogues.

Dialogues are among the most misunderstood writing tools. Many writers are mistaken about the function they fulfill in the story: they ask them to serve as scaffolding for the narrative, to play the role of narrative structure. And the result is dialogues that seem artificial, forced, and false.

But the worst mistake about dialogues is the extreme opposite: rather than asking too much of the dialogues, thinking they should resemble real conversations.

KEY POINT: The dialogues of a story are not the conversations of life. They are composed of highly selective language that gives them a realistic air.

KEY POINT: Good dialogues are always smarter, wittier, more metaphorical, and better argued than real-life conversations.

The lines of the least intelligent and least educated character cannot fall below the threshold of intelligibility. And even when a character is wrong, they are wrong more eloquently than in "real life."

Like the symbol, dialogue is a technique of the small. Added to the top of the whole constituted by structure, characters, theme, story universe, symbols, plot, and scene weaving, it is the most subtle of narrative tools. But it nevertheless carries enormous power.

Dialogue is better understood when compared to music. Like music, dialogue is a form of communication based on rhythms and tones. And like music, dialogue is of better quality when it mixes a number of "tracks." The problem with most authors is that they write their dialogues on only one track, the "melody." Their dialogues only explain what is happening in the story. Single-track dialogues are the hallmark of mediocre writers.

Good dialogue is not a melody; it is a symphony, played on three major tracks. These three tracks are narrative dialogue, moral dialogue, and key words or phrases.

Track 1: Narrative Dialogue – Melody

Narrative dialogue, like melody in music, is the story expressed through speech. These are words that talk about what the characters are doing. We tend to think of dialogue as the opposite of action. "Actions speak louder than words," it is often said. But speech is a form of action. Narrative dialogue is used when characters talk about the main line of action. And dialogue can, for short periods of time, carry the story on its own.

Narrative dialogue is written in the same way as a scene is constructed:

• Character no. 1, who is the main character of the scene (but not necessarily the hero of the story), formulates their desire. As an author, you must know the outcome of this desire, which will give you the line (the backbone) to which all the lines of the scene will cling.

• Character no. 2 criticizes this desire.

• Character no. 1 reacts with lines based on a direct or indirect plan.

• As the scene progresses, the conversation becomes more and more heated. It ends with lines that express anger or appeasement.

There is an elaborate technique that consists of moving, in a scene, from lines about action to lines about being. In other words, moving from lines that deal with what the characters do to lines that deal with what the characters are. When the scene reaches its hottest point, one of the characters says: "You are..." And they add what they think of the other character. For example, "You are a liar" or "You are pathetic," or even "You are a genius."

You will notice that this transition gives the scene immediate depth, as the characters suddenly start talking about how their actions define what they are deeply. The character defining the other is not necessarily right. But their simple statement leads the reader or viewer to form a clearer idea of what they themselves think of the characters at this point in the story. This technique constitutes a kind of realization on the scale of the scene and often requires lines that relate to the characters' values (see "Track 2: Moral Dialogue"). The transition from action to being is absent from most scenes; it is generally found only in key scenes. Let's now study an example from a scene in The Verdict.

THE VERDICT

(novel by Barry C. Reed, 1980; screenplay by David Mamet, 1982)

In this scene, Mr. Doneghy, the victim's brother-in-law, reproaches attorney Frank Galvin for refusing a settlement without consulting him first. We are about halfway through the scene:

INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY – DAY

DONEGHY

[...] Four years... My wife cried so much she can't sleep anymore. For what they did to her sister.

GALVIN

Listen, I swear I wouldn't... I wouldn't have refused their offer if I didn't think I would win the case.

DONEGHY

What does it matter what you think? I'm a working man and what I want is to get my wife out of this town. We hired you, we give you a percentage. And what do I learn from the other side? That you were offered two hundred thousand dollars!

GALVIN

I'm sure to win. I'm going before the jurors with a solid case, I have... I have a famous doctor as a medical expert. You're going to get what, five or six times what...

DONEGHY

You big shots, you're all the same. The doctors, the hospital or you, it's always: "See what I'm doing for you?" And then when the shot misses, it's: "But we did the best we could, we're really sorry." And poor people like us, we live with your mistakes for the rest of our lives.

Track 2: Moral Dialogue – Harmony

Moral dialogue deals with right and wrong actions, and also with values, or what makes life valuable. It's the equivalent of harmony in music, as it provides depth and texture to the melodic line and broadens its scope. In other words, moral lines do not deal with the events of the story. They deal with the characters' attitudes toward these events.

Here's how a moral dialogue should unfold:

• Character no. 1 proposes or exposes an action.

• Character no. 2 opposes this action by explaining that it will hurt others.

• The characters attack and defend, each arguing in favor of their position.

In moral dialogue, characters invariably express their values, tastes, and preferences. Remember that a character's values are actually the expression of a deeper idea about what the right way to live should be. Moral dialogue, at its most advanced stage, allows for the comparison through debate not only of two actions but also of two ways of life.

Track 3: Key Words, Lines, Repetitions, and Sounds – Refrains, Variations, and Leitmotifs

Key words, lines, repetitions, and sounds represent the third track of dialogue. These are words that have the potential to carry a particular meaning from a symbolic or thematic point of view, much like a symphony will use certain instruments, such as the triangle, here and there to highlight a particular moment in a piece. To build this meaning, you must ensure that your character pronounces the word or words in question much more often than necessary. Repetition, especially when done in multiple contexts, has a cumulative effect on the audience.

A repetition is a line that appears several times throughout the story. Each time it is used, it takes on a particular meaning until it becomes a sort of slogan of the story. Repetition primarily serves to express the theme. Among classic repetitions, we can cite: "Round up the usual suspects," "I stick my neck out for nobody," and "Here's looking at you, kid" (Casablanca); "What we've got here is a failure to communicate" (Cool Hand Luke); "May the Force be with you" (Star Wars); "If you build it, he will come" (Field of Dreams); and the two great repetitions from The Godfather: "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse" and "It's just business, it's not personal."

A good example of repetition use can be found in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. When the line is first spoken, it has no particular meaning. Butch and Sundance, who have just robbed a train, see a posse in the distance. "Who are those guys?" Butch asks. A little later, as the posse gets closer, Sundance repeats the question, this time with a hint of despair. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that Butch and Sundance's main mission is to determine the identity of "those guys." Because they are not the usual posses that the heroes have such ease in eluding. These lawmen, hired by Eastern industrialists, are Western stars that Butch, Sundance, and the audience never even meet. But if Butch and Sundance don't find out in time who those guys are, they will die.

SCENES

Let's now see how certain types of scenes can both apply and modify the basic principles of scene construction and symphonic dialogue.

The opening
The opening scene establishes the foundations for all the characters and actions of the story, which is probably why it is so difficult to write. As the first scene of the inverted triangle that is the story as a whole, it must create a framework that defines the scope of the narrative. The first scene generally tells the audience about the subject of the story. But it can also be a mini-story in itself, with characters and actions that dramatically produce a highly dynamic opening.

This is why it can be useful to think of the first scene as a small inverted triangle within the large inverted triangle that is the story:

As it provides the framework that defines the story, the opening scene also suggests the major thematic structures—of identity and opposition—that the author will weave throughout the story. But to prevent the scene from becoming theoretical or moralizing, these major structures must always be anchored in very specific characters.

To understand how the principles of the opening scene work, they must be seen in practice, which is why we will now analyze the first two scenes of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID

(William Goldman, 1969)

The first two scenes of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid constitute one of the greatest openings in cinema history. The construction of the scenes and the dialogues by screenwriter William Goldman not only attract the audience's attention in a very pleasing way but also establish the foundations of the thematic structures and oppositions that will determine the entire story.

Scene 1: Butch at the Bank

In the first scene, a man (whose identity is still unknown to the audience) carefully observes a bank that is closing for the night.

• Position in the character arc This is the opening scene of the story and the first look at the main character, Butch. It is also step 1 of the hero's journey: a robber in the Wild West who will eventually die.

• Problems

1. Introduce the universe of the narrative, notably the outlaws in a Wild West on the verge of disappearing.

2. Introduce the main character, who is part of a pair in a friendship story.

3. Hint that the hero, like the West itself, is getting old and is also about to disappear.

• Strategy

1. Create a typical Butch and Sundance experience that will introduce the key thematic structures.

2. Present in a single scene the essential process of the entire story: a whole world closing in.

3. Do it in a light and amusing way while hinting at a darker aspect and future.

4. Show a man considering robbing a bank but finding that this task was much easier to accomplish in "the good old days."

5. Trick the viewer by omitting to reveal the man's identity. By forcing them to gradually realize that he is actually a robber scouting the place, the screenwriters made the final joke even more amusing and also presented the hero as a con artist and a man with a lot of charm.

• Desire Butch wants to scout the bank for a robbery.

• Outcome He discovers that the bank's security is much more elaborate than he thought and that the bank is closing.

• Adversaries The guard and the bank itself.

• Plan Butch uses a ruse, pretending to be interested in the building's aesthetics.

• Conflict The bank, like a living thing, closes in on Butch.

• Twist or revelation The man observing the bank is scouting it for a robbery.

• Moral debate and values Aesthetics vs practicality. Of course, the comedy comes from this idea of aesthetics applied to the bank, especially by a man who wants to rob it. But the function of this opposition is not solely comedic. It is actually the central value opposition of the story. The universe of the narrative is a world that is becoming increasingly practical, but Butch and Sundance are, first and foremost, men of style, in love with a way of life that is rapidly disappearing.

• Key words and images The bars lowering, the countdown ending, the light fading, the space closing in.

The dialogues point to the central line of the scene, with the key phrase and word coming last: "It's a small price to pay for such beauty." What is noteworthy is that this line corresponds to the moment of the main character's identity reveal: this man is a con artist (a bank robber) whose mode of action is speech. The line has two opposing meanings. On one hand, the man mocks the bank's aesthetics; he wants to rob it. On the other, this line truly defines the character's identity: he is a man of style, and it is this quality that will kill him.

Scene 2: Sundance Playing Poker

In this scene, a man named Macon accuses another of cheating at cards. Macon tells the man to return his money and leave. But the cheater turns out to be the famous Sundance Kid, and Macon nearly loses his life.

• Position in the character arc This scene marks Sundance's starting position in his character arc, that of a robber who will eventually die. It also tends to provide more details on the previous presentation of Butch's character.

• Problems

1. Introduce the second main character of this friendship story and show how he differs from the hero.

2. Show the two friends in action; and above all, show that they are a team.

• Strategy Goldman created a second prototype scene whose impact on the plot is nil. Its sole function is to clearly define the characters very concisely.

1. In contrast to the first scene, the second defines the characters through conflict and crisis, as crisis tends to immediately clarify the essence.

2. The second scene defines first and foremost Sundance, but also Butch, who is seen in action and can be compared to his partner.

3. This scene presents the two men working as a team, somewhat like musicians. Sundance creates the conflict; Butch tries to calm it. Sundance is a taciturn man; Butch, the classic con artist, is charming.

4. To create a crisis scene, Goldman starts with a strong moment of classic Western intrigue, poker, but overturns the preconstructed expectations this implies for the audience. He replaces the usual show of strength with the ridiculous scene of a man defending his honor when accused of cheating. And Goldman overturns the classic scene again, making his character go from the ridiculous to a greatness that surpasses all Western heroes.

5. Goldman's key strategy is to deceive the audience about Sundance's identity at the very moment Sundance is deceiving his opponent. We will return to this shortly.

• Desire Macon wants to take all of Sundance's money and kick him out of the saloon after stripping him.

• Outcome Macon is humiliated but realizes he made the right choice when Sundance shows what he is capable of when he has a weapon in hand.

• Adversaries Sundance, then Butch.

• Plan Macon does not use deception. He directly tells Sundance that if he refuses to leave, he will kill him.

• Conflict Macon and Sundance argue over the game, and the conflict escalates to the point where both men draw their weapons, with one of them facing death. Butch then tries to calm the conflict by negotiating a deal, but he fails.

• Twist or revelation Goldman has entirely constructed this scene around twists. Note that he conceals information to deceive the audience along with Macon. At first glance, Sundance appears to be in a position of weakness, a weakness he exacerbates when he childishly insists he didn't cheat. And Sundance weakens himself further in the audience's eyes when Butch reminds him that he's getting old, that he's on the decline.

So, when the tables turn abruptly, Sundance makes a strong impression on the audience. The spectators understand that he is an action hero by the way he handles his weapon at the end of the scene. But the true proof of his greatness is his ability to deceive the audience and his willingness to act as if he could lose. Sundance is truly very strong.

• Moral debate and values This situation is an extreme example of warrior culture: the public display of strength, competition based on physical abilities and courage, the importance of a man's name and reputation. Butch would never engage in such things; he comes from a more affluent social background than Sundance. He just wants everyone to stay alive and move on.

• Key words and images Aging, time closing in on the characters—but not completely yet.

The lines of the show of strength are very concise, sometimes limited to one sentence per character, which tends to give the impression that these fighters are exchanging words like blows. But most importantly, the dialogues are highly stylized and witty, with the precision of rhythm and timing of a stand-up routine. Even Sundance, the man of action, proves to be a master of verbal conciseness. When Macon asks him, "What's the secret of your success?" he simply replies, "Prayer." Sundance's first line is just two words, and his stylish insolence perfectly defines the character.

You will notice that in the second section of the scene, we shift to a conflict opposing Sundance to Butch. These friends are so close that they argue even when facing a life-threatening situation. Butch's lines are also concise and stylish, but they also highlight Butch's diplomatic qualities, as well as one of the story's major themes: aging and the difficulties of adaptation that come with it.

The heart of the scene plays on the absurdity of the solution Butch and Sundance have invented together to get out of this extremely dangerous situation. Although he appears to be in a position of weakness, Sundance says, "If he invites us to stay, we'll leave." Strangely, Butch reports this proposal to Macon but tries to soften the humiliation by asking, "How about asking us to stick around a bit?" and adding, "You don't have to mean what you say, you know." In addition to showing the audience, by stylishly modifying a typical Western situation, what each of them is capable of, Butch and Sundance reveal that they form a great team. A great comedic team.

After this long preamble, Butch delivers the central line: "I can't help you, Sundance." Again, you will notice that Goldman placed the key word, "Sundance," at the end of the line. Suddenly, the characters' status shifts, the terrifying Macon is terrified, and the comedic teamwork of Butch and Sundance comes to an end. Macon says, "Stick around a bit, why not?" and Butch, always courteous and considerate, replies, "Thanks, but we have to go."

This scene ends with an obvious trap: Macon asks Sundance if he's really as good as they say, and Sundance responds with a demonstration of his remarkable physical skills, confirming through action what the audience had already guessed through words. But again, you will notice that the thematic key line of the story comes last, forming the final point of the triangle of this opening scene and evoking the final point of the film itself. Butch says, "What did I tell you?—on the decline." This undeniably sarcastic comment is at odds with the performance Sundance just executed and the verbal ruse that allowed the two characters to deceive Macon and the audience. It is only later, with hindsight, that the audience will understand that these two characters are indeed on the decline, but they don't know it, and this ignorance will be the cause of their death. These scenes are truly brilliantly written.

TECHNIQUE: THE FIRST SENTENCE

The opening sentence takes the principles of the opening scene and condenses them to the extreme. It is the most general statement of the story and frames the subject of the narrative. But at the same time, it must have a certain dramatic power, have a dynamic effect. We will now study three classic examples of opening sentences. We have added to these opening sentences some of the sentences that follow to help you better understand how the sentence fits into the author's overall strategy for the scene and the entire story.

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

(Jane Austen, 1813)

• Position in the character arc Before even the heroine, there is the universe of the narrative—a world where women seek to marry.

• Problems

1. Jane Austen must make the reader understand that this is a comedy.

2. She must give some indication of the universe of the narrative and its rules of operation.

3. She must let the audience know that the story will be narrated from a woman's point of view.

• Strategy Start with a seemingly serious sentence that seems to state a fact and an act of universal altruism but is actually an opinion on an act that is purely self-interested. The content of the first sentence tells the reader that the story will deal with marriage, how women and their families seek good matches, and the essential connection, in this world, between marriage and money.

After presenting the general arena of the story comically in the first sentence, the author focuses on the particular family that will apply the principles of the opening throughout the story. You will notice that these opening sentences do not present an ounce of superfluousness.

It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife, and, however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

"Do you know, my dear, that Netherfield Park is let at last?" said Mrs. Bennet to her husband one day.

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.

"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."

This was invitation enough.

DAVID COPPERFIELD

(Charles Dickens, 1849-1850)

• Position in the character arc Through the use of the narrator, the author creates a hero who is at the end of the arc but speaks of the very beginning of that arc. The hero will therefore be very young at first but will have a certain wisdom.

• Problems

1. When telling the story of a man's life, where do you start and where do you end?

2. How do you explain to the reader the type of story you are going to tell them?

• Strategy Use first-person narration. Have the narrator say, in the chapter title: "I Am Born." Four little words. But with incredible force. This chapter title is actually the opening sentence of the book. The narrator plants the flag of his own life. "I am important, and this is going to be a great story," he tells us. This narrator also indicates that he is about to tell us a coming-of-age story that takes the form of a myth, starting with the hero's birth. It is a very ambitious story.

After this brief but powerful sentence, Dickens adds: "Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show." Immediately, he makes the audience understand that the hero thinks in terms of story (he is, after all, a writer) and seeks to fully realize the potential of his life. He then returns to the precise moment of his birth, which is extremely presumptuous. But if he does so, it is because this event contains a dramatic element: the hero was born as the clock struck midnight.

Dickens's opening strategy has one last consequence: the reader settles comfortably into the story. The author tells them: "I am going to take you on a long but fascinating journey. So sit back, relax, and let me guide you through this world. You won't regret it."

I AM BORN

Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night. It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.

In consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by the nurse, and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be unlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and spirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to all unlucky infants of either gender, born towards the small hours on a Friday night.

THE CATCHER IN THE RYE

(J. D. Salinger, 1951)

• Position in the character arc In a sanatorium, Holden Caulfield recalls events that happened the previous year. He is therefore quite close to the end of his development, but he lacks the final insight that will come to him once he has remembered the story and told it.

• Problems

1. He must determine when to start this story that concerns him and define what this story should include.

2. He wants to explain to the reader what he really is through the way he will tell his own story, not just by what he will say about himself.

3. He must express the theme and basic values that will guide the story and the character.

• Strategy

1. Write in the first person, thus putting the reader in the hero's mind and telling them that it is a coming-of-age story. But since the hero tells the story from a sanatorium and speaks in "bad boy" language, the reader understands that what they are about to read is actually the opposite of the classic coming-of-age story.

2. Surprise the reader by creating a narrator who is aggressive towards them. Warn the reader, directly and bluntly, that they will not read a sweet and superficial childhood story and that Holden will not "kiss up" to them to gain their sympathy. The consequence of all this is that the narrator will be brutally honest. In other words, telling the truth as he saw it is a moral imperative for him.

3. Write a long, rambling sentence whose form will express the hero's personality and the nature of the plot.

4. Immediately reference David Copperfield and express some disdain for this defining version of the 19th-century coming-of-age story. The audience thus understands that everything the narrator is about to say will be the opposite of David Copperfield. Instead of a grand plot and a great journey, they will be presented with a small plot, even an anti-plot, and a small journey. This allusion also suggests an ambition: the author implies that he is about to write a coming-of-age story for the 20th century that will be as good as the best coming-of-age stories of the 19th century.

But most importantly, the reader understands that the value that will guide the hero and dictate the narration of the story will be sincerity. Expect real characters, real emotions, and real transformations, if any occur.

If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how
As this film is a social fantasy, it is not just about a debate between two people arguing over personal issues. What is at stake is how an entire society should live. This dialogue is therefore also political. We do not mean political ideas concerning a specific issue; those ideas would soon become obsolete. We are talking about human politics, the relationship between populations and their leaders. What is particularly brilliant here is the extremely emotional and personal language the screenwriters have given to this overall vision. They focused on a single action—the closure of the loan company—and personalized it by associating it with the death of the hero's father.

You will notice that, except for a short exchange in the middle, the scene is composed exclusively of two monologues. These monologues are quite long and break with Hollywood's conventional wisdom, which requires short lines and quick back-and-forth exchanges. But each character needs time to build the defense of their way of life. If the screenwriters had not rooted this debate in a personal dispute between two characters who despise each other, this scene could have been a political philosophy essay.

• Position in the character arc With his father's death, George has just experienced his first disappointment regarding his desire (to travel the world and build things) and sacrifices himself for the first time for his family and friends. He is now about to go to college to fulfill his dreams.

• Problem The screenwriters must construct a fight that involves the values on which the town and America itself must rely. And they must do so without appearing preachy.

• Strategy

1. Have the hero and the main adversary debate the future of an institution—the loan company—on which the entire town is founded, as well as the man who built this institution but is now dead.

2. Focus the entire philosophical debate on one word, "rich," in the last sentence of the hero's monologue.

• Desire Potter wants to close the loan company.

• Outcome He fails because George prevents him.

• Adversary George.

• Plan Potter directly states he wants to close the company, and George directly opposes him.

• Conflict The conflict intensifies when Potter shifts from the institution to Potter's father in his remarks.

• Twist or revelation Young George is able to stand up to the man who intimidates the entire town.

• Moral debate and values The exchange between the two men amounts to an in-depth examination as it is a classic example of conflicting values. You will notice that these two monologues are extremely well constructed. These men develop very precise arguments that represent two opposing systems from a political and philosophical point of view.

Potter's arguments and values

1. There is a great distinction between businessmen and men of high ideals.

2. Lacking common sense, ideals can ruin an entire town. This argument suggests to the audience that the town itself is the battlefield and that the essential question of the film will be: what lifestyle will make this battlefield, this world, a more pleasant place to live?

3. Potter then cites a specific example, that of Ernie Bishop, the friendly taxi driver, already known and liked by the audience. The viewer has seen that Ernie is not the type of crook, but Potter claims that if he got a loan to build his house, it is only because he is friends with George.

4. The result of this type of arrangement, according to Potter, is that the saving proletarians become bitter and idle scoundrels. This argument reveals Potter's sinister value system: America is a class society, and Potter feels perfectly comfortable in his role as leader of the lower class. With this argument, the dialogue may go a bit too far: Potter becomes not only the typical patriarch but also the evil capitalist.

5. Potter ends up attacking the very symbols of what George is: the dreams and personal, friendly contacts that make the small town a pleasant place to live.

George's arguments and values

KEY POINT: To strengthen George's arguments, the screenwriters put them in the mouth of his father a few scenes earlier. At that time, George had expressed a view opposed to his father's. This strategy tends to make George's eloquence in this scene both more credible and more poignant.

1. George starts brilliantly by conceding a point to Potter: his father was not a businessman, and he himself is not very interested in his business, which does not bring in much.

2. He then moves on to an argument that is primarily in favor of his father: he was a selfless man, although this quality did not allow George and Harry to go to college.

3. Then he attacks Potter on his own turf, business. He tells him that his father helped people out of the slums of the town, and these people thus became better citizens and better consumers, capable of contributing to the wealth and well-being of the entire community.

4. And he pushes the argument even further by pleading for the heroism of the weak. The people Potter calls "idle scoundrels" are those who work, who pay, and who die the most for the community; they give themselves body and soul. And if the community is to be the place that allows people to thrive, no one can be treated as a member of a lower class.

5. George ends with the most important of all his arguments, that of the inalienable rights of human beings. His father treated each person as a human being, as an end in itself, whereas Potter treats people like cattle, like soulless animals that can be led wherever one wants. In other words, Potter treats human beings as means to his end, namely making more and more money.

KEY POINT: While presenting the most general argument—the rights of the ordinary man—the screenwriters converge towards a very personal plan with the key line and word that come at the end.

If Potter does all this, it is, according to George, because he is "a bitter and twisted old man." This line plays a decisive role in the film not only because it describes Potter but also because bitterness is one of the most obvious characteristics of George's character.

Then comes the last line, the culmination of the scene: "Well, [my father] died a hundred times richer than you will ever be!" The word "rich" has two different meanings. The most obvious—having a lot of money—qualifies Potter. But the deeper one—who gives and receives a lot from others—defines George.

• Key word "Rich."

INT. BAILEY'S OFFICE AT THE LOAN COMPANY – DAY

POTTER

Peter Bailey had no business sense. That's what led him to the grave. Oh, I don't want to speak ill of him. May he rest in peace because he was a hardworking man with high ideals, as they say. But an ideal without an ounce of common sense can ruin this town.

(He grabs a paper on the desk.)

Let's consider the advance made here to Ernie Bishop. You know him, a loafer who stays in his taxi all day without thinking and doing nothing useful. I recently learned that the bank refused him any advance. So he came here, and our company is building him a house on credit worth more than five thousand dollars. Why?

George is at the office door, holding his coat and files, ready to leave.

GEORGE

I studied this case, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers concerning it. His salary, his insurance. And I personally guarantee his honesty.

POTTER

(Sarcastically)

Is he one of your friends?

GEORGE

Yes.

POTTER

Perfect. You see, if you play ball with a simple company employee, they build you a house. Ha ha ha! But where does it lead? To flatter a clientele of idlers and lazy people instead of promoting a worthy class. And all this only because of a few dangerous dreamers like Peter Bailey who fill their heads with a lot of impossible and grotesque ideas. So I say...

George puts down his coat and approaches the desk, furious at what Potter just said about his father.

GEORGE

Just a moment. Please listen, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father wasn't a man who cared about money. Why did he ever think of founding this loan and construction company? I couldn't tell you. But I will never tolerate anyone raising a doubt about his honesty, because throughout his life, because throughout the time he ran this business with Uncle Billy, he always refused to think of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He wanted to send Harry to college, he never could save the necessary money. But he pulled a number of his fellow citizens out of your slums, Mr. Potter. So you all have the business habit here. Are they worse citizens? And don't they pay regularly? You said earlier... You said these unfortunate people should wait before having a house built, before living in a place worthy of a human being. Allow me, but wait for what? Wait until their children have grown up and left them? Do you know how long it takes a worker to save five thousand dollars? Remember, Mr. Potter... remember that all these loafers you talked about are the most numerous to work, to spend their money in our community. Do you really think these poor people don't have the right to live in houses with at least two rooms? I know my father had a different view. To my father, they were men! To you, who don't see their pride, they are just beasts unworthy of interest. Well, my father died a hundred times richer than you will ever be!

SHADOW OF A DOUBT

(original story by Gordon McDonell, screenplay by Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson, and Alma Reville)

Shadow of a Doubt is probably one of the best thriller scripts ever written. The film tells the story of Uncle Charlie, a man who comes to visit his sister in a small American town. His niece, young Charlie, initially admires him deeply but gradually comes to believe he might be the serial killer known as "The Merry Widow Murderer."

Thornton Wilder's script is a model because it blends drama techniques with the thriller genre, thus transcending this form. A good illustration of this approach is found in the famous scene where Uncle Charlie justifies his murders on a moral level. A lesser screenwriter would have made the killer opaque, a monster who needed no justification due to his fundamentally monstrous nature. But the story would then have been limited to being the chronicle of a killing machine.

Wilder, on the contrary, chose to give the killer detailed and understandable moral arguments, which makes him even more terrifying. Uncle Charlie attacks the dark side of American life—the greed and the fact that the vast majority of people have not achieved the American dream—that most Americans themselves prefer to sweep under the rug.

• Position in the character arc The adversary does not have his own character arc in the story. But this scene occurs at a crucial moment in the heroine's development. Young Charlie was already very suspicious of the uncle she once revered. This moment corresponds to the shift from her former attraction to her new repulsion for the adversary. And she despairs of understanding how this happened.

• Problem How to make the adversary hint at the motives for his murders without stating or admitting them clearly?

• Strategy Gather the whole family around the dinner table so that the justification takes place within the family and appears as part of the everyday and normal life of Americans. Push Uncle Charlie's sister, Mrs. Newton, to ask her brother to give a speech at her women's club to provide him with a good reason to rant against elderly women. Then horribly dissolve this mundane world to plunge into terror.

• Desire Uncle Charlie wants to justify his disgust for women, especially elderly women, in front of his niece, whom he also seeks to frighten.

• Outcome He realizes he has gone too far.

• Adversary His niece, young Charlie.

• Plan Uncle Charlie uses an indirect plan that involves philosophizing about city women in general, allowing him both to maintain his cover and to connect with the only person at the table who understands him.

• Conflict Despite young Charlie's single counterattack, the conflict builds mainly through the escalation of hatred towards women that emerges from Uncle Charlie's speech.

• Twist or revelation The good Uncle Charlie thinks most elderly women are no better than animals to be led to the slaughterhouse.

• Moral debate and values Uncle Charlie's moral arguments are simply terrifying. He begins by calling elderly women useless. Then he reduces them to sensual beasts devouring money. He ends by explaining that it is morally right to end the suffering of these too fat and too old animals. The values in opposition here are utility and humanity vs. money, sensuality, uselessness, and animals.

• Key words Money, women, useless, greedy, animals.

If this dialogue is so frightening, it is because it is both trivial and atrocious. It starts with the everyday life of couples and arrives at the idea that women can be compared to animals. You will notice that the key line, the last one, is in the form of a question. Uncle Charlie does not go straight to the point; he does not state that all women of a certain age should be put down. He asks his niece what should be done, and, because of the power of his terrible logic, young Charlie seems to have a hard time reaching a different conclusion than he does.

The excellence of the construction of this scene and its dialogues also comes from the comic commentary Wilder placed at the end. Uncle Charlie's older sister, Mrs. Newton, is completely unaware of what her brother is really saying. She thus brings the scene back to its origins, the speech Uncle Charlie will have to give before the women's club, and the audience understands that it's a bit like letting the wolf into the sheepfold. Moreover, Uncle Charlie's very maternal older sister has already chosen a nice widow for her brother.

INT. DINING ROOM – NIGHT

Uncle Charlie is now pouring wine into glasses. He acts meticulously and speaks in a relaxed manner.

UNCLE CHARLIE

What kind of audience is it?

MRS. NEWTON

Oh, women like myself. Mostly busy with their homes.

Uncle Charlie starts speaking, and it feels like his words come from the depths of his resentment.

UNCLE CHARLIE

In this kind of small town, women are active. In big cities, it's different. They are full of elderly women whose husbands have passed away. Husbands who spent their lives amassing capital but worked themselves to death. And at their death, of course, the money goes to their wives... to their weeping widows. And what do these widows do with this hard-earned money? They are found in the lounges of the best hotels in useless flocks. Eating their fortune, devouring it. Engaged in bridge games late into the night... and reeking of money. Proud to show off their jewelry for lack of anything else. Horrible, made-up, faded, fat, and greedy.

He is suddenly interrupted by young Charlie's voice, off-screen.

YOUNG CHARLIE'S VOICE

But we're not going to kill them for that, they are human beings!

He looks in her direction as if she just woke him up.

UNCLE CHARLIE

Do you think so? Do you think they are still human? Haven't they become some kind of impotent larvae, huh? And what do you do with an animal that has become too old and impotent?

(He suddenly calms down.)

(He laughs.)

Oh, but I feel like I'm already giving my little speech.

Young Charlie hastily grabs her fork. She lowers her eyes. We hear Mrs. Newton say:

MRS. NEWTON

Well, for heaven's sake, don't talk about women like that in front of my club. You'd get lynched quickly! Really, what an idea!

(She teases him.)

Especially since that charming Mrs. Potter will be there too. She asked about you, you know?

The monologue

The monologue is a particularly useful technique for the craftsman that is the author. Dialogue allows the writer to draw truth and emotion from the ordeal that is the conflict between characters. The monologue allows him to draw truth and emotion from a conflict that is within the character himself.

A monologue is a mini-story that unfolds in the mind of a character. It is another form of miniature, a summary of what the character is, his main struggle, and the process he goes through throughout the story. You can use it to present in detail to the audience the depths of a character's mind. Or to show the intensity of the pain he feels deep inside.

To write a good monologue, you must first and foremost tell a whole story, which means, as always, going through the seven narrative steps and placing a key word or phrase at the end.

THE VERDICT

David Mamet used a monologue to conclude the confrontation scene in The Verdict. Since this monologue is included in the plea the hero presents to a jury, Mamet did not have to justify its use through a "realistic" intermediary, as seen in most American films. If this monologue is extremely well-written, it is not because it tells a complete story. It is because it tells two stories: the journey of the woman the hero defends and the hero's own life journey.

• Position in the character arc Frank has already had his awakening. We are here at the final stage of the arc: by winning the trial, Frank proves he has indeed had an awakening.

• Problem How to summarize the plea while giving it maximum dramatic impact?

• Strategy Develop the plea and the moral judgment request made to the jury by secretly describing Frank's personal development.

• Desire Frank wants to convince the jury to restore justice.

• Outcome He realizes that each juror is a human being who wishes for justice to be done.

• Adversaries All the rich and powerful who crush and weaken us.

• Plan His plan is to speak from the heart and make justice a matter of sincerity.

• Conflict This monologue presents a man struggling to understand and do what is right while asking the jurors to act in the same way as him.

• Twist or revelation The viewer realizes that Frank is not just talking about the case but also about himself.

• Moral debate and values Frank's moral argument in favor of justice is a true seven-step story. It starts with people feeling lost, feeling like powerless victims (weakness). These people want to do the right thing (desire), despite the rich and powerful who constantly belittle them (opposition). When you become aware of your power (plan), when you believe in yourself (awakening), it is possible to act justly (moral decision, final confrontation, new balance).

• Key words Justice, believe.

GALVIN

Well... you know there are so many times when we are lost. We say, "God, please tell us what is right, tell us what is true." And there is no justice, the rich win, the poor are powerless. We end up being tired of hearing lies. And we end up playing dead. We are dead, we come to see ourselves... as victims... and we become victims. We become... we become weak. We doubt ourselves, we doubt our beliefs. We doubt our institutions. And we doubt the law. But today you are the law. You are the law. Not a law book, not the judges, nor the marble statue of justice, or the court ceremonial. These are just symbols of our desire to be just. But they are... they are actually a prayer. I mean a fervent and fearful prayer. In my religion, it is said: "Act as if you had faith, and then faith will be granted to you." If... if we want to have faith in justice, we just need to believe in ourselves and act justly. And I believe there is justice in our hearts.

Watch this film if you want to see what a great actor can do with a beautifully written monologue.

The end

Chekhov said that the last ninety seconds of the play were the most important of all. It is true that the final scene is the convergence point of the entire story. Sometimes, this scene includes one of the last plot twists in the form of an awakening. But generally, everything related to the plot has already been dealt with. And the final scene becomes, like the opening scene, a miniature of the entire story. The author presents the thematic structures one last time, and the audience realizes that these particular characters just introduced to them are part of a larger world. In short, the audience has a thematic revelation.

To write a great ending, you must understand that the final scene will be the tip of the inverted triangle that is the story, and that it will itself be an inverted triangle, with the key word or phrase—of the scene and the story—coming last:

The final scene must be the ultimate expression of the funnel effect we have already talked about: at the end, the key word or line creates a huge explosion in the audience's mind and continues to resonate long after the story concludes.
Let's now study some great final scenes. This will help us better understand how dialogue and scene construction work at this decisive moment in the story.

THE SUN ALSO RISES

(Ernest Hemingway, 1926)

This story follows the wanderings of a group of friends traveling across Europe, as well as a particular character who cannot live with the woman he loves due to a war injury that left him impotent. As it is a great impossible love, the characters are drawn into a whirlwind to a point where life is just a succession of movements toward sensation. They are idle people, aware of the trap they have fallen into, but unable to escape it.

The final scene is prototypical of the characters' actions. After dining, Jake and Lady Brett Ashley hit the road again. Someone drives them somewhere in a taxi. As the scene converges toward its conclusion, Brett utters a line typical of her character: "Oh, Jake, we could have been so happy together." This worldly, even disposable line is also the symbol of the entire story. What could have been a great romantic tragedy has been reduced to "a good time."

Jake then delivers a line typical of his character: "It's nice to think so." Cursed not only by his injury but also by a sensitivity that allows him to have illusions and be aware of them, Jake is damned for eternity.

Downstairs, we crossed the ground floor hall to go out into the street. A boy went to fetch a taxi. The air was warm and bright. Up the street, there was a small square with trees and grass where taxis waited. A taxi arrived with the boy on the running board. I tipped him and told the driver where we wanted to go. Then, I settled next to Brett. The driver started. I leaned back in the car. Brett moved closer to me. We were sitting very close to each other. I put my arm around her, and she nestled comfortably against me. The air was hot and bright, and the houses were a stark white. We turned onto the Gran Via.

– Oh, Jake, said Brett, we could have been so happy together!

Ahead of us, a khaki-clad officer was directing traffic from atop his horse. He raised his baton. The taxi slowed down abruptly, pressing Brett against me.

– Yes, I said. It's nice to think so.

THE SEVEN SAMURAI

(Akira Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto, and Hideo Oguni, 1954)

In The Seven Samurai, the screenwriter's technical mastery reaches the level of a masterpiece. The screenplay of this film is among the best ever written, and it masterfully and literally executes all the techniques presented in this book. The final scene leaves the audience devastated, yet pleasantly surprised that such greatness is possible in human beings.

In this story, seven samurai have gathered around altruism and love for their warrior art to protect villagers from marauding bandits. Katsushiro, a young apprentice samurai, has fallen in love with Shino, a peasant girl. The battle is over; the samurai and villagers have won. But on the hill, four of the great warriors lie in their graves. And Shino has turned her back on the young warrior and joined the other farmers to plant what will be the next harvest.

Alongside Shichiroji, the other surviving samurai, Kanbei, the leader of the samurai, watches as a witness to Katsushiro's heartbreak, the farmers planting new life, and the graves of his four comrades on the hill. And he has a final realization: although victorious, the samurai have lost, and their entire way of life is disappearing. The deep differences that separated people, and which had temporarily vanished, are back, and the heroism of the dead warriors was as brief as a breath of wind.

Taken out of context, this scene might seem like a poorly formulated realization. But for many reasons, it cannot be considered this way. First, it is set after an epic battle in which seven samurai defeated forty bandits solely to save a few farmers who were strangers to them. It is therefore an enormous emotional upheaval. Furthermore, this scene is an important unveiling, and it is placed at the very end of the story, much like the shocking twists that mark the end of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects. Finally, it is a thematic revelation through which the hero glimpses the death of an entire social world, a world that is, in many ways, magnificent.

EXT. VILLAGE – DAY

Kanbei lowers his head and looks at the ground. He takes a few steps toward the camera, then stops and turns to look at the rice fields. Then he returns to stand next to Shichiroji.

KANBEI

It's another lost battle.

Shichiroji is surprised. He looks at Kanbei questioningly.

KANBEI

It's the farmers who are the real winners. Not us.

Kanbei moves away from the camera and looks up; Shichiroji does the same. The camera slides along the slope of the burial hill, leaving the two samurai behind to focus on the four mounds of earth silhouetted against the sky. The music of the samurai covers that of the planters as the wind blows dust over the mounds of earth.

THE GREAT GATSBY

(F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925)

The Great Gatsby is rightly famous for its ending. Gatsby is dead. Nick has realized the emptiness of his quest for success in the big city and has decided to return to the Midwest. He takes one last look at this wealthy enclave on the East Coast.

Fitzgerald's ending deserves close study. Through Nick, he tells us that the great mansions are closed for the season. This is a specific fact that, in the story, signifies the end of the false utopia of the grand and rich parties that died with Gatsby. Then Fitzgerald makes a leap in time while broadening the scope of his story when Nick imagines the island as it was at the beginning of America, a virgin paradise, full of potential, "the green breast of a new world" and "the last and greatest of all human dreams." This creates a sad comparison with the island as it is today, where the true desires of real people like Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom have turned the lush forests into false idols – the grand houses and flamboyant, vain parties.

From this general comparison, Fitzgerald refocuses on a specific point, a person, Gatsby, again, whose desire pointed, like a laser, toward the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. Gatsby is this vain dreamer who, like a mythical hero, does not realize that he already had everything he needed at the beginning, in the "dark fields" of the Midwest he left behind.

As Fitzgerald approaches the tip of the triangle, the end of the scene and the story, he evokes the symbol of this false desire, the green light. Unlike many stories that end artificially with the fulfillment of the hero's desire, The Great Gatsby ends with the unfulfilled desire, the effort that redoubles as our human goal recedes into space. The last sentence is a thematic revelation that sums up the entire story: "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."

Most of the waterfront mansions were already closed, and there were hardly any lights except those, uncertain and moving, of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher, the useless mansions began to fade until, by degrees, I had the impression of being on the ancient island that had once flowered in the eyes of Dutch sailors – the green breast of a new world, its vanished trees, the trees that had given way to Gatsby's mansion, had for a time whispered to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a fleeting enchanted moment, man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.

And, sitting there, reflecting on the old unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.

Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter – tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning...

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.

BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID

(William Goldman, 1969)

If the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has one of the best openings in cinema history, it also has one of the best endings. And in many ways, one can say that the final scene is a reflection of the first two scenes.

• Position in the character arc The tragic thing about these two immediately likable characters is that they cannot change. They cannot learn. The new world arrives too quickly for them. They are doomed to die.

• Problem How to create an ending that expresses the essential qualities of the heroes and presents the consequences of their inability to adapt?

• Strategy As in the first scene, the characters find themselves in a confined space that closes in on them. As in the second scene, the characters face a crisis that defines them: in this scene, by the way they face death with extreme confidence – sure they can get out of it. And Butch has already planned their next stop. Butch is always the one with ideas, while Sundance remains the one who must get them out of the problems resulting from Butch's mistakes.

Again, Goldman highlights the team's excellence when Butch runs to get ammunition while Sundance covers him. If Sundance was impressive when he shot Macon's gun to make it fall, he is literally stunning when he draws at record speed to shoot all the policemen within reach. But what makes the audience love this team is its comedic aspect. The incessant and amusing quarrels of the two characters, present from the beginning with the excitable Butch and the quietly skeptical Sundance, show the audience once again that this is a perfectly matched pair.

But Goldman introduces a new contrast here that expresses the main theme and the lack of transformation in the characters: these two men do not understand the new world that is arriving. Goldman alternates their comedic quarrel about Butch's latest idea to dodge the future – Australia – with the arrival of what seems to be the entire Bolivian army. The extreme contrast between what the heroes know and what the audience knows highlights a fact whose foundations were established from the beginning of the story: Butch and Sundance see no further than the end of their small personal world. Although they are very likable, they are not as smart as they seem.

This contrast carries a final realization that touches not the heroes, but the audience: even supermen must die. And it's very sad.

Again, the last line is the key line of the scene and the story. When Butch asks Sundance if he has seen their arch-enemy, Lefors, around and Sundance replies no, Butch declares: "Good. For a moment there, I thought we were in trouble."

MASTERPIECES OF SCENE CONSTRUCTION

I would like to take one last look at dialogue techniques and scene construction by studying two great films, Casablanca and The Godfather. These films are masterpieces of the art of storytelling, and their dialogues and scene construction are brilliant. Since, for writing scenes, much of your success depends on your ability to place each scene in the character's development arc, I would like to study scenes from the beginning and end of these two films.

CASABLANCA

(play, Everybody Comes to Rick’s, by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, screenplay by Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein, and Howard Koch, 1942)

First scene between Rick and Louis

In this scene, which occurs quite early in the story's development, Rick and police captain Louis Renault chat cheerfully before the arrival of Major Strasser and the arrest of Ugarte.

• Position in the character arc This is the first stage of the development of the relationship between Rick and Louis, a relationship that will lead to their mutual redemption and the formation of a "couple" in the last scene of the story.

This scene helps to understand why you should always start constructing a scene by determining its place in the character arc. Since it is not the first scene of the film, it feels like a step among others in the flow of the story's unfolding. You need to know the outcome of Rick's arc – becoming a freedom fighter and befriending Louis – to understand that this is an opening stage that plays a decisive role in the arc.

• Problems

1. Show the audience that Louis is as witty as Rick and can become an ideal friend for him at the end of the story.

2. Show that Louis's moral need is just as important as Rick's.

3. Provide more information about Rick's ghost, especially information that reveals that this cynical and tough man was once not only good but also heroic.

• Strategy

1. Have Louis question Rick under the pretext that he is trying to arrest Laszlo and that it is part of his job, and have Rick reveal information about his past. This is an excellent way to introduce the main character's exposition without seeming awkward. Moreover, Rick's insistence that he was well paid for this mission prevents him from appearing too sentimental or idealistic.

2. Have Rick and Louis bet on Laszlo's future. This gives the two men a common line of desire and allows them to present the cynical and selfish character they share: both turn the quest of a freedom fighter seeking to defeat the Nazis into a trivial gambling game.

3. Introduce information about Laszlo and Ilsa so that both can arrive preceded by their reputation.

4. Provide more information about the complex power relations between Louis, the French police captain, and the Nazi, Major Strasser.

• Desire Louis wants to learn more about Rick's past. Then he seeks to convince Rick not to help Laszlo escape.

• Outcome Rick claims he is only interested in Laszlo's fate to the extent that it can bring him money through the bet.

• Adversary Rick is Louis's adversary.

• Plan Louis asks Rick very clear questions about his past and advises him quite directly not to get too close to Laszlo.

• Conflict Rick and Louis disagree on Laszlo's fate, but Rick defuses the conflict by turning these differences into a bet.

• Twist or revelation Laszlo, the great freedom fighter, a character we have not yet met, has arrived in town with a remarkable woman. Moreover, Rick, the tough cynic, was himself a freedom fighter a few years earlier.

• Moral debate and values This exchange is rather an immoral debate. For their bet, the two men wonder if Laszlo will manage to escape, not if he should escape. Besides, Rick maintains that he will not help Laszlo and that he did not act for moral reasons when he fought for the "good" side in Ethiopia and Spain. Rick also says he thinks Laszlo will get an exit visa and leave his companion in Casablanca.

The opposition of values is very clear in this scene: it's money and self-interest vs. romance and altruistic fighting for good.

• Key words Romantic, sentimental.

The lines of the two characters are very stylized and witty in this scene. Louis doesn't just ask Rick about the ghost of his past. He asks: "Did you run off with the church funds? Did you run off with a senator's wife? I'd like to think you killed a man. It's the romantic in me." Rick doesn't just tell him to mind his own business. He says: "I came to Casablanca for the waters." And when Louis reminds him that Casablanca is in the middle of a desert, Rick replies: "I was misinformed."

INT. RICK'S CAFE AMERICAIN OFFICE – NIGHT

RICK

Alfred! Since he escaped from their concentration camp, the Nazis have been searching for him all over Europe.

RENAULT

Today they have him.

RICK

I'll bet you twenty thousand francs they won't.

RENAULT

Is your offer serious?

RICK

I just lost a hundred thousand. I want to get even.

RENAULT

Let's say ten thousand. I'm just a poor civil servant. [...] He may be clever, but he still needs a visa. And even two.

RICK

Why two?

RENAULT

He's traveling with a woman.

RICK

He'll leave her behind.

RENAULT

I bet he won't. I've seen her. If he didn't leave her in Marseille or Oran, I'm sure he won't leave her in Casablanca.

RICK

He may not be as romantic as you think. [...] And what gave you the impression that I might help this person escape?

RENAULT

For the simple reason that beneath your cold and cynical exterior, you're a great sentimentalist, Rick.

Final scene with Rick and Louis

The final scene of Casablanca is one of the most famous in cinema history. Rick has sacrificed his love for Ilsa and deliberately sent her away so she can support her husband, Victor Laszlo. He must then face his former adversary, who is also his stylistic equal.

• Position in the character arc

1. It is the culmination of the process by which Rick commits and becomes a patriot and freedom fighter.

2. Structurally, this scene is a double reversal, marked by the transformation of two characters, Louis and Rick.

3. It is also the culmination of Rick's relationship with Louis, with the two men ending up forming a "couple" of friends.

• Problems

1. How to give this final scene a powerful dramatic impact?

2. How to present the transformation of two characters in a way that is both credible and not too boring?

• Strategy

1. Wait until the very end of the story to reveal to the audience Louis's transformation and present the creation of this new team of friends.

2. Use the double reversal so that Rick and his equal both have a realization, but emphasize maintaining their pragmatic opportunism. What makes this scene great is the return to the bet, which allows both men to undergo a significant moral transformation while retaining their tough aspect. This avoids falling into sentimentality.

• Desire Louis wants to join Rick in his fight and start a friendly relationship.

• Outcome Rick warmly welcomes him.

• Adversaries It seems for a while that Rick and Louis might still be adversaries, especially on the issue of the bet and Rick's escape. But Louis eventually eases the conflict.

• Plan Louis hides his true intentions by pretending he might still oppose Rick on the issue of his exit visa or the bet.

• Conflict Rick negotiates with Louis for his exit visa, and Louis negotiates with Rick for the sum he owes him. But Louis ends this bargaining with a decision that will birth a great friendship.

• Twist or revelation Louis doesn't want to arrest Rick; he wants to join him. But it will cost Rick the 10,000 francs he just won.

• Moral debate and values The two men accept the idea that it's time to become patriots. But without forgetting money matters.

• Key words Patriot, friendship.

The final scene converges toward a precise point of the scene and the story: friendship. Rick has lost his great love, but he ends the story with an excellent friend who is his equal. The scene is designed to lead to the great twist: Louis's stylish way of joining Rick in his moral action. The dialogue is sharper and more sophisticated than any other. But what makes it even better is that it is impromptu.

The last thing to note about this dialogue is that it is both extremely witty and dense. The screenwriters managed to summarize enormous movements of the story in a few lines, and the impact on the audience is immense. Rick performs his noble action. There is an exchange of lines, and Louis performs his noble action by discarding the Vichy water. Louis proposes an arrangement for Rick's escape. Three short sentences. Rick brings up the bet again. Three short sentences. Louis mixes the escape with the bet, one sentence. Rick understands what happened. And the last sentence speaks of eternal friendship. This series of associations produces a great upheaval at the very end of the film's final scene. The screenwriters clearly understood how to apply Chekhov's rule regarding the last ninety seconds of the story.

EXT. AIRPORT – NIGHT

RENAULT

Ah, well done, my dear, you're not only a sentimentalist but also a patriot.

[...] Renault throws the Vichy water into the trash. Rick and Renault watch the plane take off and then disappear into the fog. They leave together.

RENAULT

You might do well to leave Casablanca for a while. You could join De Gaulle in Brazzaville. And who knows, I might give you a hand.

RICK

And a good safe-conduct. Anyway, it doesn't change our conventions. We had a bet of ten thousand francs, you owe me.

RENAULT

And those ten thousand francs will cover part of our expenses.

RICK

Our expenses?

RENAULT

Uh-huh.

RICK

Ah! Yes, I understand. You mean a new life begins for both of us.

THE GODFATHER

(Novel by Mario Puzo, screenplay by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, 1972)
To understand how the screenwriters of The Godfather constructed the scenes and wrote the dialogues for this great film, we must start with an overview of the story. Here is how we could very concisely summarize the strategy or narrative process they sought to implement in the film:

1. The transfer of power from one king to the next.

2. Three sons, each endowed with different qualities, attempting to become king.

3. A family counterattacking to ensure its survival and to win.

Let us now examine some of the major thematic structures that the screenwriters wanted to follow in this story. First come the identifications, that is, the elements of the story that we normally conceive as distinct from one another, but that the screenwriters wanted to present as identical on a deeper level. The three most important are:

• The mafia family likened to a business

• The mafia family likened to a military organization

• The profane likened to the sacred and the sacred likened to the profane: “God” likened to the devil

We must then focus on the major structures of opposition, the key elements that the screenwriters wanted to contrast and place in conflict. The major structures of opposition are:

• Family vs law

• Family and vengeance vs American justice

• Immigrant America vs WASP America and the American elite

• Men vs women

If we were to write the scenes of this film, the last step we would go through would be the clarification of values and symbols, or key words, that come into conflict throughout the story. It is only by studying the story as a whole that one can determine which objects or images play a central or organic role. They can then be highlighted through repetition (track 3). In The Godfather, these values and symbols are divided into two main groups: honor, family, business, appearances, and crime vs freedom, country, and moral and legal action.

Opening Scene

The average screenwriter would have started The Godfather with a plot scene to give this great violent story a fast-paced start. He would have exclusively composed the scene of narrative dialogues (track 1) to give an even faster start to the plot. But Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola are not average screenwriters. Guided by the principle of the inverted triangle of the story and the scene, they created a typical experience that frames the entire story while converging towards a single point at the end of the scene:

• Position in the character arc As this story follows the fall of a king and the rise of his successor, the opening scene does not mark the starting point of the new king's (Michael) journey. The story begins with the current king (Don Corleone) and the first scene presents his actions, as well as those of his successor.

• Problems When writing the story of a “king” in a democracy, there are many problems to solve in the opening scene:

1. Introduce the Godfather, and show what a Godfather does.

2. Begin to present the unique operating system of the Mafia, including the power hierarchy and the rules that organize it.

3. Announce the epic scope of this story so that the viewer immediately becomes aware of one of the main thematic points: the world of this family is not a ghetto he could look down upon but a world that symbolizes the nation.

4. Present some of the identifications and oppositions that the screenwriters will weave throughout the story.

• Strategy

1. Start with a typical experience of the Godfather, who acts as a judge and exercises absolute power over his surroundings.

2. Place the essential scene of the Godfather in a larger and more complex world – a wedding – where all the characters who are part of the system are gathered and where the central element that constitutes the family is highlighted.

• Desire Bonasera wants the Don to kill the boys who beat his daughter. In this world, Bonasera is a truly minor character. But he knows absolutely nothing about the system on which the Mafia is based. He is therefore the spectator. The screenwriters used him to lead the scene so that the audience learns at the same time as he does how this system works and understands what it feels like to enter this world. Moreover, the full name of this character, Amerigo Bonasera, could be translated as “Good evening, America.”

• Outcome Bonasera is trapped by the Don.

• Opponent Don Corleone.

• Plan Bonasera uses a direct plan: he asks the Don to kill the two boys, then he asks how much he wants to be paid. This direct approach results in a negative response.

Eager to enlist another person in his network, the Don uses an indirect plan: he pushes Bonasera to feel guilty for the way he has behaved with him in the past.

• Conflict The Don, unhappy with the various offenses Bonasera would have committed against him and continues to commit, refuses to accede to his request. But it should be noted that the construction of the conflict is limited in this scene, as the Don is all-powerful and Bonasera is not fooled.

• Twist or revelation The Don and Bonasera reach an agreement, but the audience understands that Bonasera has just made a pact with the devil.

• Moral debate and values Bonasera asks the Don to kill the two boys who beat his daughter. The Don replies that it would not be fair. Then he cleverly turns the moral argument against Bonasera, explaining that he would have offended and disrespected him.

• Key words Respect, friend, justice, Godfather.

The opening scene of The Godfather shows us that great dialogues are not just melodic; they are also symphonic. If the scene had been composed solely of narrative dialogues, it would have been twice as short and would have lost nine-tenths of its quality. But the screenwriters wrote the dialogue on three simultaneous tracks, and this scene is a masterpiece.

The scene ends with Bonasera uttering the word “Godfather” at the very moment he falls into the trap of the Faustian pact. It begins with these words, which frame the story: “I believe in America.” This is a value, and this value tells the viewer two things: he is about to experience an epic, and this story will deal with the means of achieving success.

The scene begins with a monologue delivered in a place that is practically devoid of details. With his monologue, Bonasera does not just tell the sad story of his daughter; his words are full of values and key words such as “freedom,” “honor,” and “justice.” Don Corleone responds by formulating a small moral attack, which puts Bonasera on the defensive. Then Don Corleone, acting as Godfather-judge, delivers his sentence.

There is a quick exchange of lines, with the characters disagreeing on moral issues, notably on the nature of justice. Then Bonasera, who represents the spectator, makes a mistake, as he does not know the rules of the system. He does not know how people are paid here.

A twist then occurs, and it is now the Don who leads the scene. He develops moral arguments, overflowing with values such as respect, friendship, and loyalty, designed to make Bonasera his slave. The Don pretends to simply want to make Bonasera his friend, but Bonasera understands the true goal of the Don's indirect plan. He lowers his head and utters the key word of the scene: “Godfather.” This word is followed by the last and most important line of the scene. The Godfather says: “One day, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a service for me.”

This line has the same form as the pact the devil made with Faust. The Godfather and the devil merge. The “sacred” equals the profane. End of the scene!

Let us now study the opening scene of The Godfather in its framework, with its three threads – narrative dialogue, moral and values dialogue, and key phrases and words – distinct, yet all pointing towards the eye of the vortex. We will thus see how the determining scenic techniques of symphonic dialogues and vortex combine to create one of the best opening scenes in the history of cinema.

INT. DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

The Paramount logo is presented austerely on a black background. There is a moment of suspense and then these simple words in white letters:

THE GODFATHER

These words are still displayed when we hear: “I believe in America.”

The opening line of the dialogue falls under track 2, and probably track 3. The words “I believe” refer to a value. And the word “America” is probably a key word, although it cannot be stated with certainty since it has not yet been repeated. However, as it is the name of the country, there is little chance of being wrong.

It is on this opening line that the screenwriters plant the flag of the epic. The classic definition of the epic is that the fate of a nation is determined by the actions of a single man or family. The authors directly inform the audience that this story will deal with America. And that it will be a dark vision of America.

Suddenly, we see in close-up AMERIGO BONASERA, a man in his sixties dressed in a black suit who seems to be in the grip of violent emotion.

BONASERA

America has made my fortune.

As he speaks, the SHOT begins to widen imperceptibly.

BONASERA

I raised my daughter as a true American.

This line, which evokes a value, falls under track 2, but also track 3, in the repetition of the evocation of America.

I told her: you are free,

Again, tracks 2 and 3. Freedom is a value and, if the term is repeated, it becomes a key word.

but above all you must never dishonor your family.

Track 2: the value of never dishonoring one's family. And probably key words, for “honor” and “family.” Honor and family are the two most important values of the gangster story genre, and in this film, they are introduced from the start.

She had a little flirt,

This line marks the beginning of track 1, the narrative dialogue that describes what happened to Bonasera's daughter and why he came to see the Don.

not an Italian.

Back to track 2, value.

Often, they went to the movies, she came home very late, without me protesting. Two months ago, they went for a drive with a friend of her flirt. They forced her to drink whiskey. And then, they tried to take advantage of my daughter. She resisted;

These lines all fall under narrative dialogue.

she saved her honor.

Back to track 2, and repetition of the key word, “honor.”

Then they beat her like an animal. When I saw her at the hospital, her nose was broken, and her jaw fractured. It was held together with wire. She couldn't even cry because it hurt so much.

He now has difficulty speaking; he sobs.

BONASERA

[…] So, I went to the police like a true American.

Value, and repetition of the key word, “America.”

They put these two dogs on trial. The judge, he first sentences them to three years in prison, and then he grants them a suspended sentence. A suspended sentence! They walked free that very day! I looked at the court like a poor fool, and these two bandits, they smiled at me. So I said to my wife: “For justice, we must go to Don Corleone.”

This last line is rich in meaning. It introduces the value of justice, as well as the probable key words that are “justice” and “Godfather.” It also introduces the fundamental thematic opposition of the story: American legal justice vs the Godfather's personal justice.

BONASERA

[…] What do you want from me? Ask me anything, but give me what I ask of you!

DON CORLEONE

What do you ask?

BONASERA whispers in the DON's ear.

Bonasera uses a direct plan, and we quickly understand that he has asked the Don to kill the boys. As is usually the case with direct plans, the answer is no.

DON CORLEONE

No. That I cannot do.

BONASERA

I will pay you anything you ask.

The SHOT is now wide, and we can see Don Corleone's office in his house. The blinds are closed, the room is dark with shadowy areas. We see BONASERA over DON CORLEONE's shoulder. TOM HAGEN, sitting near a small table, examines documents, and SONNY CORLEONE gets up impatiently to join his father at the crossroad while sipping a glass of wine. We HEAR music, as well as the laughter and voices of many people outside.

This paragraph introduces the main characters in the power hierarchy of this mafia family. The last sentence evokes the broader universe of the story, but is in direct contrast with Bonasera sobbing in the room. Something is wrong, but we do not know what it is.

DON CORLEONE

We have known each other for years, but this is the first time you have come to me for advice or a favor. I don't even remember the last cup of coffee I came to have at your house... yet my wife is the godmother of your only child.

Don Corleone immediately goes on the attack. We are on track 2, the moral dialogue. The attack is not violent, but the Don wants to make Bonasera understand that he has not felt treated with friendship and respect, two values he will mention later.

The following monologue is a harsh moral attack led by Don Corleone against Bonasera for his poor values and behavior.

DON CORLEONE

You have rejected my friendship.

Key word: “friend.”

[…] You had paradise in America.

Key word: “America.”

[…] The police, the courts to protect you. You didn't need a friend.

Key word: “friend.”

Today, you come to me crying and say: “Don Corleone, give me justice!”

Key word: “justice,” but now redefined as personal justice.

Do I see a little respect? Do I feel a little friendship? Does it occur to you to call me Godfather?

Key word: “respect,” “friendship,” “Godfather.”

No, you come to me on the day my daughter Connie is getting married and you offer to pay me for a murder.

We now understand what the laughter and voices outside correspond to. This scene, in the Don's personal court of justice, takes place within the larger community moment of a wedding.

BONASERA

What I ask is justice.

DON CORLEONE

That would not be justice, your daughter is still alive.

This quick exchange falls under track 2, a moral debate on the nature of true justice, obviously close to that of the Old Testament.

BONASERA

I want to see them suffer as much as she suffers. How much must I pay?

HAGEN and SONNY both react.

This general comment actually means that they react badly, as Bonasera has just made a big mistake. But he does not know it, and neither do we, the spectators. Bonasera asks for a service and knows he will have to pay for it. What he does not know is that the currency of this system is not money, but favors owed.

Since we are Bonasera, we make the same mistake as he does. And we feel the same embarrassment when we realize we have made this mistake. This is the powerful effect obtained by the emotional, not intellectual, explanation of the rules of the mafia system. Entering the lion's den is simply terrifying.

DON CORLEONE

Bonasera, Bonasera. What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? Had you come to me as a friend, then the scum who harmed your daughter would already be suffering. And if, by chance, a man like you had an enemy to complain about,

Key words and values: “friendship,” “respect.”

then his enemy would become mine. And he would fear you.

Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs:

BONASERA

Be my friend.

In appearance, the Don demands a friend-to-friend relationship, that is, an equal-to-equal relationship. But Bonasera is not fooled. He knows that what the Don is really asking for is a master-to-slave relationship. So he bows his head and repeats the key word, “friend,” but which must now be understood with its new meaning: “your servant.”

Here is a perfect illustration of the vortex technique within a scene. This complete exercise on justice, with its contrast between American legal justice and personal justice, spirals down to the key word and key phrase of the scene. This is the eye of the vortex, presenting the typical experience of the Godfather with maximum dramatic power.

BONASERA

Godfather.

DON CORLEONE

Good, one day, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a service for me.

The key word “Godfather” is immediately followed by a line that is vaguely familiar and vaguely unsettling, although we do not yet know why. It is a line from “Faust,” also found in many fairy tales. Bonasera is satisfied to have obtained a form of justice from the Godfather, even if it is not what he asked for. He therefore does not understand that he has just made a pact with the devil.

Key word followed by a key phrase: “Godfather” = devil. Maximum dramatic impact, and we exit the scene.

This is a brilliantly written scene. And its quality comes from the use of the three tracks of dialogue and the eye of the vortex.

Final Scene

This end, which is the tip of the inverted triangle of the story, is both a “trial” – Connie accuses Michael of murder – and a coronation. This final scene echoes the opening. We move from the typical experience of the Godfather ending in a diabolical pact to the coronation of a new demonic king.

• Position in the character arc Michael is accused of being a murderer by his sister while completing his rise by becoming the new Godfather. Michael also reaches a kind of culmination in his marriage to Kay, the mistakes he has made being irreparable.

• Problems How to make a moral argument against Michael without making him accept it.

• Strategy

1. Put this argument in the mouth of Connie, a woman, who is moreover hysterical, and thus discredit it in Michael's eyes.

2. Do not attribute the realization to Michael but to Kay. And do not base this realization on Connie's words but on what Kay sees in her husband.

• Desire Connie wants to accuse Michael of Carlo's murder.

• Outcome The door closes on Kay's face.

• Opponents Michael, Kay.

• Plan Connie uses a direct plan: she accuses Michael of her husband's murder in front of everyone.

• Conflict The conflict starts at an intense degree then dissipates at the end.

• Twist or revelation Michael lies to Kay, but Kay sees what Michael has become.

• Moral debate and values Connie claims that Michael is a heartless murderer who does not care about her. Michael simply refutes her accusations by suggesting that she is sick or hysterical and needs to see a doctor. Then he denies it to Kay.

• Key words Godfather, emperor, murderer.

INT. DAY: DON'S OFFICE

Connie rushes into the house where Michael and Kay are and enters the office.

CONNIE

Michael! You bastard! You killed my husband. You waited for dad to be dead to do whatever you want! You killed Carlo! You think it's because of him that Sonny died but everyone believes it. You never thought of me. You don't care about me.

(She cries.)

What am I going to do now?

KAY

Connie…

CONNIE

Why do you think he kept Carlo at home? I'm telling you it's because he had decided to kill him, that's all. To think he's the godfather of our son. But you're a bastard! A murderer! Do you want to know how many guys he had killed with Carlo? It's on the front page! Look at the newspapers! That's your husband.

MICHAEL

Take her upstairs. Call a doctor.

The bodyguard gently but firmly grabs Connie by the arms and takes her away.

Kay is in shock, staring at Michael in astonishment. He feels her gaze on him.

MICHAEL

She's hysterical. Hysterical...

Kay does not take her eyes off him.

KAY

Michael, is it true?

MICHAEL

Don't ask me about my business.

KAY

Is it true?

MICHAEL

No questions about my business! […] Okay, this is the only time... the only time I'll let you ask me about my business.

She looks him straight in the eyes. He holds her gaze, so intensely that we know he will tell her the truth.

KAY

Is it true? Is it…

MICHAEL (AFTER A LONG MOMENT)

No.

Relieved, she throws herself into his arms. He embraces her and then kisses her.

KAY

I think we really need a drink.

INT. DAY: DON'S KITCHEN

Kay goes into the kitchen to prepare the drinks. Through the open door, she sees Clemenza, Neri, and Rocco Lampone enter the office with their bodyguards.

She watches with curiosity as Michael, at ease, a hand on his hip like a Roman emperor, receives them. The caporegimes stand before him.

Clemenza takes Michael's hand and kisses it.

CLEMENZA

Don Corleone…

The smile fades from Kay's face as she observes what her husband has become.

WRITING SCENES – WRITING EXERCISE NO. 9

• Character transformation Before writing any scene, you must formulate your hero's transformation in a single sentence.

• Scene construction When constructing a scene, ask yourself the following questions:

1. What position does this scene occupy in your hero's arc and how does this scene lead him to the next stage of his development?

2. What problems do you need to solve and what do you need to accomplish in this scene?

3. What strategy will you use to achieve this?

4. Which character's desire will drive the scene? Remember that it does not necessarily have to be the hero of the story.

5. What does the character's desire lead to in this scene?

6. Who seeks to prevent the character from achieving his goal?

7. What type of plan – direct or indirect – will your character use to achieve his goal?

8. Will the scene end at the peak of the conflict or will there be a resolution?

9. Will this scene include a twist or a revelation?

10. At the end of the scene, will one of the characters make a comment on the deep nature of another?
• Scenes without dialogue Initially, try writing scenes without dialogue. Let the characters' actions tell the story. This way, you'll have a "clay" that you can mold and refine endlessly.

• Writing dialogues

1. Narrative dialogue: Rewrite each scene using only narrative dialogue (Track 1), meaning dialogue concerning the characters' actions in the plot.

2. Moral dialogue: Add moral dialogue to each scene (Track 2), meaning arguments that define the characters' actions as good or bad or comments on the characters' values (what they believe in).

3. Keywords: Rewrite the scenes again, highlighting key words, phrases, repetitions, and sounds (Track 3), meaning objects, images, values, or ideas that play an essential role in your story's theme.

When writing the three tracks of your dialogues, imagine you are creating a portrait of someone. You start by sketching the outline of the face (narrative dialogue). Then you add the play of light and shadow that gives depth to the face (moral dialogue). And you finish by drawing the finest lines and details that make this face unique (keywords).

• Unique voices Ensure that each character has a unique way of expressing themselves.

The Neverending Story

A great story is immortal. And this is not a platitude or a tautology. A great story continues to affect the audience long after it has been told for the first time. It literally continues to tell itself. But how can a story become a living thing that will never die?

A neverending story is not a story that is so interesting that it becomes unforgettable. You can only create a neverending story by using certain techniques related to narrative structure. But before presenting these techniques, we must examine the opposite of the neverending story: the story whose life and power are cut short by an artificial ending. There are generally three types of artificial endings: the premature ending, the arbitrary ending, and the closed ending.

A premature ending can be due to many causes, including early realization. Once the hero has had their great realization, their development is complete, and everything that happens afterward is uninteresting from a plot perspective. The second cause of a premature ending is the hero succeeding too quickly. If they are then given a new desire, a new story begins. And the premature ending can also be due to an action undertaken by the hero that is not credible because it is not organically suited to the character's personality. When characters, especially the hero, are forced to act implausibly, the audience is immediately and brutally pulled out of the story, with the "gears" appearing on the surface. The audience understands that if the character undertakes this action, it is because you need them to (mechanical) and not because they need to (organic).

An arbitrary ending is an ending that occurs for no apparent reason. Arbitrary endings are almost always due to a non-organic plot. The plot does not follow the development of a single entity, whether it is a single main character or a social unit. If nothing develops, the audience does not feel that something will come to fruition or conclude. A classic example of this type of ending is found in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Twain follows Huck's development, but due to the journey plot he uses, his hero literally ends up in a dead end. Twain is forced to rely on coincidence and deus ex machina to finish his story, disappointing all those who found the rest of the narrative particularly brilliant.

The most common type of artificial ending is the closed ending. The hero achieves their goal, has a simple realization, and lives in a new balance where everything is calm. These three structural elements give the audience the feeling that the story is complete and that the system has closed. But this is false. Desire never stops. Balance is temporary. Realization is never simple, and it cannot guarantee the hero will live happily ever after. A great story, always being a living thing, cannot have a more definitive and certain ending than any other part of the story.

But how can you create this sense of breath, pulse, and perpetual evolution that endures long after the last word has been read or the last image has been seen? To find out, we must return to where we began, to the essential definition of the story, which is a structure in time. The story is an organic unit that develops over time, and it must continue to develop long after the audience has stopped watching it.

Since the story is always a whole, and the end is found in the beginning, a good story always ends by signaling to the audience to return to the beginning to experience it again. The story is an endless circle—a Möbius strip—that is always different because the audience is always rethinking it in light of what has just happened.

To create a neverending story, the simplest way is through the plot, by ending the story with a twist. This technique involves creating an apparent balance, which is immediately destroyed with one last surprise. This twist leads the audience to rethink all the characters and actions that led them to this point. Like a detective reading the same clues but seeing a very different reality, the reader or viewer hurries to mentally return to the beginning of the story and reshuffle the cards to reach a new combination.

This technique is masterfully executed in The Sixth Sense when the audience discovers that the character played by Bruce Willis has been dead since the beginning of the story. Its implementation is even more stunning in The Usual Suspects, when the weak narrator leaves the police station and transforms before our eyes into a terrible adversary he himself created, Keyser Söze.

The twist-turnaround, though spectacular, remains a limited means of creating a neverending story. Because it only offers you a new cycle with the audience. The readers or viewers hadn't thought of it at the beginning. But now they know. There will be no more surprises. By using this technique, you don't get so much a neverending story as a story told twice.

Some authors say that you cannot create a neverending story with a plot that is too powerful, a plot that dominates the other narrative elements too much. Because even plots that end with a great twist leave the audience feeling that all the shutters of the house are now closed. The key has been turned; the puzzle is complete; the case is closed.

To tell a story that always seems different, it is not necessary to kill the plot. But you must use each of the systems of the story's body. By weaving a complex tapestry composed of characters, plot, theme, symbols, scenes, and dialogues, you allow readers or viewers to retell the story endlessly. They will have to rethink so many narrative elements that the possibilities for combinations will become limitless, and the story will live forever. Here are just a few methods you can use in your story to make it an infinite tapestry:

• The hero fails and does not fulfill their desire, but the other characters manifest a new desire at the end of the story. This prevents the narrative from closing and shows the audience that desire, even vain or unattainable, never dies ("I want, therefore I am").

• Have an adversary or secondary character undergo an astonishing transformation. This technique can lead the audience to revisit the story by considering this character as the true hero.

• Place a large number of details in the background of the story's universe, details that can, when the story is repeated, come to the forefront.

• Add elements of texture—to the characters, the moral debate, the symbols, the plot, and the story's universe—that become much more interesting once the plot's surprises and the hero's transformation have been seen.

• Create a relationship between the narrator and the other characters that will completely change meaning once the audience is aware of the plot. The unreliable narrator is just one way among many to achieve this.

• Make the moral debate ambiguous, or do not reveal what the hero decides to do when faced with the final moral choice. As soon as you go beyond the stage of simple moral debate—good versus evil—you force the audience to reevaluate the hero, the adversaries, and all the secondary characters to determine what constitutes a good or bad action. By hiding the final choice, you compel readers or viewers to question the hero's actions again and to ponder this choice in the context of their own lives.

The main problem we faced in this work was to present a practical poetics—the storytelling techniques found in all forms of stories. This involved explaining how to create a complex living story that develops in the minds of readers or viewers and never dies. It also meant overcoming what appeared to be a dreadful contradiction: telling a story that has universal appeal but is also completely original.

Our solution was to present you with the secret workings of the story world. We wanted you to discover the dramatic code—the way human beings evolve and change throughout their lives—in all its splendor and complexity. This book presents many techniques to express the dramatic code in a powerful and original story. If you are serious, you will never stop studying and practicing them.

But technical mastery is not enough. Allow me to end with one final revelation: you are the neverending story. If you want to tell the great story, the neverending story, you must, like your hero, personally face the seven steps. And you must do it every time you write a new story. I have tried to provide you with the plan: the strategies, tactics, and techniques that will help you achieve your goal, fulfill your needs, and create an unlimited stock of realizations. Mastering the art of storytelling is not an easy task. But if you learn the technique and make your life a great story, your ability to tell fabulous tales will astonish you.

If you truly know how to read—and I have no doubt about that—you are no longer the person you were when you started this book. Now that you have read it once, if I may... well, you know what you have to do.
